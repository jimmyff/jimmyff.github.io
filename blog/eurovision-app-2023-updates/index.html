This updates was really well received and I personally think it's a <em>huge</em> step forward for the app! The app has received some lovely reviews over the week of Eurovision and is now 4.8⭐️/5⭐️ on both Google Play and Apple App Store!</p><img alt="Promotion details" srcset="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/update.0ad482b5bcfb0bdb.webp 512w, https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/update.94b43312afacf210.webp 1024w" title="Promotion details" class=small src=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/update.94b43312afacf210.webp><h2 id=social-scorecards-and-account-system>Social scorecards and account system</h2><p>The headline feature for this year is social scorecards. I came up with this idea last year when a friend casually asked if at her Eurovision party they could all score together on my app? I told her she couldn't but that was a fabulous idea! (Thanks Ellie!) Group scoring is an addition to the scorecard system for 2 years back. It allows you to create a 'Group'. During the development of this I was chatting to another friend (Queenie this time) and they asked if the group would have a combined scorecard -another fab idea! Initially I had planned for it to just allow you to see each others scorecards and share your realtime reactions (with emoji) but this would elevate the feature so I pushed to add this and prioritised it over seeing each others scorecards.<p>I wanted to make this work for large groups. As a member of OGAE UK (The UK's official Eurovision fan club) which around 1k members - I wanted to make sure that if a club used it, then it would work. I decided on setting a limit of 500 members for each group and worked backwards from that. Each minute a cloud function would trigger which would look for any active group scorecards, and generate the latest scorecard for that group. I could increase this to every 30 seconds during the week of Eurovision - maybe this is something I'll do in the future. People can also add emoji reactions which are shown to the group in realtime. There is a limit on the frequency these can be posted by individuals based on the group size. I added some simple management tools to the UI so the group owner manage their group.<p>I really think this feature is my apps 'Killer feature', it's something that no other app does and something I don't anticipate anyone else doing. It's quite a complex thing, and with this not being a money making app it would take someone as crazy as me to invest time in to making it work!!<p><em>(To do: Add a video of the group scorecard feature)</em><hr><h2 id=everything-is-now-free-money-with-wings>Everything is now free! 💸</h2><p>Speaking of this app not making much money -I've decided to make everything free this year. When I first implemented scorecards I set a restriction that the current/latest year required a paid 'VIP Pass' (£2.99 one off for a year or £1.99 per/year subscription). The app has always made very little money and if I want my scorecard feature to be used by lots of people then I need to life that restriction. So this year I've kept the concept of a 'VIP Pass' but I give people the choice: Watch an advert for a temporary pass or buy a subscription (£1.99 for the year or £10.99 for life). I'm really happy with this change as now the people can download my app and use it fully without paying a penny, it also works for those that don't want to watch an advert so would rather subscribe or just buy it once and own it forever. The little bit of revenue I receive contributes towards the running costs of the app.<hr><h2 id=new-scorecard-themes-layouts>New scorecard themes & layouts</h2><img alt="Scorecards showcasing different themes and layouts" srcset="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/themes.ef3490533ce8c9d6.webp 512w, https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/themes.37f8e20d243a0ec0.webp 1024w, https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/themes.1f72de2cef6b63f3.webp 2048w" title="Scorecards showcasing different themes and layouts" src=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/themes.37f8e20d243a0ec0.webp><p>I've added a 4 new scorecard themes and 2 scorecard layouts.
