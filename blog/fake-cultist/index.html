Since then the games seen a couple of fairly chunky changes and I've been gradually refining it ever since. With every iteration the play tests became smoother and the game simpler. I think that this might be my first game I actually think is ready to publish! This is uncharted territory for me -I feel like there is nothing more that I can really add or take away from the game. I'm sure there will be a little tweaking to the balance (at various player counts) but essentially the concept has been been fully realised and it actually stands-up to my expectations! It's a tight little game with a juicy little deduction puzzle!<h2 id=the-elevator-pitch>The Elevator Pitch</h2><p>When you pitch your game to publishers, often they want to see a 'Sell Sheet'. It's a single page document that gives them a very quick overview of the game. Here's my sell sheet for Fake Cultists:</p><img alt="Fake Cultists Sell Sheet" srcset="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/sell-sheet.61b6d4a8d7192913.webp 512w, https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/sell-sheet.9ddb9b7e583e45e6.webp 1024w" title="Fake Cultists Sell Sheet" class=large src=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/sell-sheet.9ddb9b7e583e45e6.webp><h2 id=so-what-s-next>So what's next?</h2><p>I ran the game a couple of times at Airecon last weekend and I have a few more big group events coming up over the few weeks. They will be perfect for a play-testing and a good opportunity to check the games' balance.<p>Publishing-wise I've actually just sent the sell sheet over a publisher that I think would be a really good fit for this game... so that's bonkers! I've never really considered how I'd feel about handing a game over to a publisher but now I'm starting on that journey I'm feeling a little protective over it! I've quite a lot of ideas about how I'd like it producing such as using black core for the box, game cards and tokens to give it a gothic vibe and spot printing with neons inks to give it a super striking table presence! The way something looks and feels is really important to me and relinquishing that control might be a challenge! Anyway, it's very early days and publishers might not be interested my little game! My fallback would be to release it as print-and-play or possibly look at self-publishing... 🫣<p>What ever happens I'll be sure to keep the blog updated with any new developments!</p><img srcset="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/cards.caf6d5e5672ba374.webp 512w, https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/cards.9fd0187bf08a93a6.webp 1024w" alt=Cover class=small src=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/processed_images/cards.9fd0187bf08a93a6.webp title=Cover></article><ul class=tags><li><a href=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/tags/tabletop-game-design>tabletop-game-design</a></ul></section></article><footer><div class=social><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/jimmyff rel=me title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@jimmyff-uk rel=me title=YouTube><i data-feather=youtube></i></a><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/faehound.games rel=me title=Bluesky><i data-feather=message-square></i></a><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/jimmyff_art/jimmyff_art rel=me title=Medium><i data-feather=instagram></i></a><li><a href=https://medium.com/@jimmyff rel=me title=Medium><i data-feather=file-text></i></a><li><a href=https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/atom.xml title=jimmyff><i data-feather=rss></i></a></ul></div><p>© jimmyff 2025 <br>Powered by <a href=https://getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a>.
