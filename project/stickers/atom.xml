        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/pop-snap-update/">&lt;p&gt;So the latest version of Pop Snap has just hit the app stores so I figured it was the perfect time to add some deets about it to my blog. This is the result of about 2 weeks work totally revamping the client app. I&#x27;ve rewritten the editor itself which has big optimisation benefits and loads of scope for further development. I had an idea late last year that I would use Gemini LLM to categorise stickers for me. I implemented that back in September and I detailed the process with a youtube a dev log which is included below. I&#x27;ve since had some help loading SVG assets (stickers) in to the system for gemini to churn through and we now have almost 20k stickers in the system! Anyway, I&#x27;ll include more details below, but if you&#x27;re tight for time, just go and &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;apps&#x2F;&quot;&gt;download the app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and have a play!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-an-ai-super-powered-control-panel&quot;&gt;Building an AI super-powered control-panel&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a CMS which allows me to bulk upload SVG assets in to the system, sanitize them, tag the colors and then process them by generating metadata with AI. I won&#x27;t go in to too much detail as I&#x27;ve gone through most of it in the devlog video below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-pipeline-system&quot;&gt;Asset Pipeline System&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big optimisations of the new version is an asset pipeline system which rasterizes the SVG graphic (with the colors, styling options required) and then feeds the back to the flutter UI, it re-renders this as the user scales and manipulates the asset. It&#x27;s a pretty cool system and makes the UI buttery smooth!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-sticker-manipulation-toolbar&quot;&gt;New sticker manipulation toolbar&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you select a sticker a toolbar appears allowing you quick access to outline tool, recolor options, flip, arrange etc. It&#x27;s nothing fancy but makes the editor nice and easy to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;haptic-feedback&quot;&gt;Haptic Feedback&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the haptic feedback I added to my Kosmos app so I did something similar here, now as your manipulate the Stickers you can feel little haptic vibrations for every few degrees you rotate, or percentage you scale. It feels really good!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;revenue-cat&quot;&gt;Revenue Cat&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and implemented Revenue Cat a couple of days ago, I couldn&#x27;t believe how simple it made subscription integration. I&#x27;ve always handled subscriptions and in-app purchases myself and it all works fine, but with this I could delete a whole bunch of code, one less thing for me to maintain. It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m considering shifting all my app to use it despite them taking a cut...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-s-next-for-pop-snap&quot;&gt;So what&#x27;s Next for Pop Snap?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text! I had hoped to add this feature this week, but Apple policy team love to faff so i&#x27;ve been playing ping-pong with them all week trying to get the new version accepted. Anyway I think Text would be an awesome feature so that&#x27;s high on my priority list. Also some basic settings to allow default skin colors etc, that will probably be next... I need to get back to on other app&#x27;s now but I&#x27;ll swing back to this in the future, and possibly try to squeeze in some more features on Friday afternoons!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days/">&lt;p&gt;During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I&#x27;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a ¬£38.99 p&#x2F;year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days&#x2F;photo_that_started_it_all.gif&quot; alt=&quot;GIF&quot; title=&quot;The photo that started it all!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, on the very long &amp;amp; hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of ¬£2.99, pay once &amp;amp; own forever. I&#x27;m sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;Sticker Party logo&quot; title=&quot;Sticker Party logo&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.78fb61e172f71cc5.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.37b1f643260560b0.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.78fb61e172f71cc5.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I&#x27;ll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I&#x27;ll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download Sticker Party on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=uk.rocketware.stickerparty&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;sticker-party&#x2F;id1634193331&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Please help get the ball rolling and give it a good rating! üòâ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
