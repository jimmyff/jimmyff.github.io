&lt;img alt=&quot;Advertising the playtest&quot; title=&quot;Advertising the playtest&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;airecon.f4c69b2c280fe785.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;airecon.f56d7da35cf74b7a.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;airecon.f4c69b2c280fe785.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;small&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year at Airecon I booked a playtest slot for my game Ultimate Quest. I&#x27;ve been working on the game heavily for the last 6-8 months and knowing that Airecon was coming up had given me a date that I knew I needed to have the first Quest fully playable. I was seeing it as a deadline to create a vertical slice of the game (the whole game but with only enough content for a single adventure) so I could determine if it will play anything like the game I have in my head.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my impending deadline I still made a huge last minute change to the game. At a Leeds Playtesting group some fellow designers gave me some feedback that I&#x27;d already heard before and had been playing on my mind. They said we love the concept (Dungeon Crawl X Yahtzee) but execution doesn&#x27;t push the yahtzee dice play far enough. Hearing this again solidified that I needed to take drastic action. So with 5 weeks before Airecon I took the decision to change a fundamental part of the game: I moved from using Polyhedral dice to standard D6&#x27;s with different colours representing different skills. I leaned much more heavily in to the Yahzee idea so now to kick down a door you would need a double red dice (red = physical). It was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of work changing everything but the game played so much better for it and what I presented was something I&#x27;m super proud of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;The new D6 dice&quot; title=&quot;The new D6 dice&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;dice.f6314b1f4c95e3d1.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;dice.090732d54e2793b6.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;dice.f6314b1f4c95e3d1.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first quest of the game I have the would-be-champions performing the rather mundane task of investigating what&#x27;s happened to Georgie the old tavern cat. This will serve as an introduction to how the game playes and some low level enemies. For the finished game I imagine quests will range from these small jobs through to exploring cast caves, temples, fighting dragons and perhaps at the end, even venturing to hell itself! I made some &quot;I Saved Georgie&quot; badges and these would be rewards for anyone who managed to complete the first Quest! -Who doesn&#x27;t want a cute cat badge?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before Airecon I played the first quest through in solo mode. I played as the Witch (a mostly support role - I was curious if this would be possible) and I had a Stone Ogre Companion, I managed to scrape throught quest and had an awesome time doing it. This game at least meets my objective of being something I found interesting and exciting, and is a game I want to play!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran 5-6 games of Ultimate Quest over the weekend and several coveted &quot;I SAVED GEORGIE&quot; badges were won with each adventuring party having their own unique adventure. One party encountered Vampires and another managed to save an young child from giant spiders! We had a Centaur Warrior torn to pieces by a pack of zombies and these are just a few of the most memorable moments!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve received some great feedback and ideas and I&#x27;ve come away feeling even more inspired, motivated and excited for the future of Ultimate Quest! A huge thank you to everyone who joined me on the adventure and played the game. I can&#x27;t wait to see where this games goes!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
