&lt;p&gt;Prism is an optimized, zero-dependency color manipulation library for Dart &amp;amp; Flutter with multiple color models, accessibility tools, and pre-built palettes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve always been fascinated with colors and color theory. I&#x27;ve designed a board game and an app around it, and in my amateur artworks I seem to subconsciously gravitate to complementary palettes (&lt;em&gt;examples: &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;glass-containers&#x2F;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;hearts&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;museum-sektching&#x2F;&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). Over the years I&#x27;ve written a couple of unpublished color libraries. The first was Chroma which I later replaced with Pigment, which I rebranded as Prism due to a name clash. The rebrand gave me a good excuse to spend a bit of time refactoring it and polishing it. I&#x27;m pleased to announce Prism is now available over on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pub.dev&#x2F;packages&#x2F;prism&quot;&gt;pub.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimmyff&#x2F;prism&quot;&gt;github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While the concepts aren&#x27;t new, Prism is a comprehensive and thoughtfully designed package that makes working with modern color spaces in Dart really easy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;Color Theory in practice&quot; title=&quot;Color Theory in practice&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;tablet_screen.a539dc774ed3e666.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;tablet_screen.9812ef092216936d.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;tablet_screen.a539dc774ed3e666.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ú® Back in 2015 I spotted this orange and blue banding on my tablet&#x27;s screen providing a little real-world demonstration of the color theory that I was reading about! üß°üíô&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what makes prism useful I need to briefly explain color spaces. These are systems for describing and storing colors:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rgb-the-color-model-of-screens&quot;&gt;RGB - The Color Model of Screens&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your phone or laptop screen creates colors by mixing light. Each pixel is made of tiny red, green, and blue sub-pixels (RGB). If all are off, you get black; if all are on full, you get white. This is great for screens, but it&#x27;s not very intuitive for humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a color lighter or change its hue, you&#x27;re just fiddling with Red, Green, and Blue values. Worse, if you try to create a gradient between two colors in RGB, you often get a muddy, greyish color in the middle. This is because the math of RGB doesn&#x27;t match up with how our eyes actually perceive color and lightness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color spaces like HSL and HSV were created to make manipulating RGB colors easier. However, they are fundamentally flawed, as their handling of lightness and value is inconsistent across different hues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklab-oklch-a-more-human-approach&quot;&gt;Oklab + Oklch - A More Human Approach&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the problem Oklab and Oklch are designed to solve. They are modern color spaces built around how humans perceive color, focusing on three things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Lightness (how light or dark it appears)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Chroma (how vibrant or intense the color is)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Hue (the actual color, like red, green, blue)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic is that &quot;Lightness&quot; in Oklch is perceptually uniform. This means you can change the hue or chroma and the perceived lightness won&#x27;t change. This is a game-changer for creating accessible UIs with proper contrast, and for creating beautiful, vibrant gradients that don&#x27;t turn to mud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the math behind this is complex (I used the brilliant formulas from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bottosson.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;gamutclipping&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bj√∂rn Ottosson&#x27;s post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to handle gamut clipping), but Prism abstracts all that away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the above gives you a little overview of why a dedicated color library is useful. Prism provides a really easy way to create, manipulate and store colors. Prism currently supports Rgb8, Rgb16, Hsl, Hsv, Oklch and Oklab color spaces, and makes it trivial to convert between them. Here&#x27;s a little example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;dart&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-dart &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dart&quot; data-lang=&quot;dart&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; Create an rgb color from hex and convert to oklch
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;final&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; red = &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;RayRgb8&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;fromHex&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#FF0000&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;final&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; redInOklch = red.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;toOklch&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;print&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(redInOklch); 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; RayOklch(l: 0.628, c: 0.258, h: 29.2¬∞)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; A darker red (with perceptually uniform lightness)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;final&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; darkRed = redInOklch.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;withLightness&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;print&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(darkRed);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; RayOklch(l: 0.300, c: 0.089, h: 29.2¬∞)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; let&amp;#39;s take it back to rgb to print the hex
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;final&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; darkRedInRgb = darkRed.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;toRgb8&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;print&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(darkRedInRgb.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;toHexStr&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;());
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; #521711
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice that the final rgb hex color (format: #RRGGBB) actually has a bit of green and blue to create the darker red.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;palettes&quot;&gt;Palettes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prism also has a palette system, this allows developers to have palettes with pre-calculated luminosity levels with RGB or OKLCH colors (this is particularly useful when working with RGB palettes as runtime calculations can be expensive). The palette sources can be pre-defined such as Material Colors, Open Colors, Tailwind or can be pre-computed using Prism (the Prism palette is called Spectrum). Spectrum builds on the Google&#x27;s Material Colors system (which offers shades from 50-900 in multiple colors) but expands it at both ends to offer shades from 0-1000 giving more choice at the extremes of the spectrum, great for doing really light&#x2F;dark themes. I&#x27;ve also expanded the color choices with hues at 15¬∞ intervals around the color wheel. The result is a palette with more nuance at the lightest and darkest extremes, as you can see in the comparison below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;prism-dart-flutter-color-package&#x2F;Spectrum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spectrum RGB palette&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;prism-dart-flutter-color-package&#x2F;Material.png&quot; alt=&quot;Material RGB palette&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a little bonus all the palettes are compiled to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimmyff&#x2F;prism&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;palette_gallery&#x2F;&quot;&gt;css and available on github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in both RGB and OKLCH formats.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s next&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve not finished porting over the Pigment library to Prism, there is still the color theory code to migrate. I use color theory to calculate palettes based on images by extracting the dominant colors and choosing aesthetically pleasing combinations of colors. Before I port this over I need to consider my approach as at the moment prism and prism_flutter require zero dependencies and i&#x27;d like to keep them that way. I&#x27;ll probably add a prism_image_analysis package at some point which will have the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pub.dev&#x2F;packages&#x2F;image&quot;&gt;package:image&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; package dependency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find Prism on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pub.dev&#x2F;packages&#x2F;prism&quot;&gt;pub.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimmyff&#x2F;prism&quot;&gt;github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Prism Flutter is also available on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pub.dev&#x2F;packages&#x2F;prism_flutter&quot;&gt;pub.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimmyff&#x2F;prism_flutter&quot;&gt;github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/pop-snap-update/">&lt;p&gt;So the latest version of Pop Snap has just hit the app stores so I figured it was the perfect time to add some deets about it to my blog. This is the result of about 2 weeks work totally revamping the client app. I&#x27;ve rewritten the editor itself which has big optimisation benefits and loads of scope for further development. I had an idea late last year that I would use Gemini LLM to categorise stickers for me. I implemented that back in September and I detailed the process with a youtube a dev log which is included below. I&#x27;ve since had some help loading SVG assets (stickers) in to the system for gemini to churn through and we now have almost 20k stickers in the system! Anyway, I&#x27;ll include more details below, but if you&#x27;re tight for time, just go and &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;apps&#x2F;&quot;&gt;download the app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and have a play!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-an-ai-super-powered-control-panel&quot;&gt;Building an AI super-powered control-panel&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a CMS which allows me to bulk upload SVG assets in to the system, sanitize them, tag the colors and then process them by generating metadata with AI. I won&#x27;t go in to too much detail as I&#x27;ve gone through most of it in the devlog video below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-pipeline-system&quot;&gt;Asset Pipeline System&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big optimisations of the new version is an asset pipeline system which rasterizes the SVG graphic (with the colors, styling options required) and then feeds the back to the flutter UI, it re-renders this as the user scales and manipulates the asset. It&#x27;s a pretty cool system and makes the UI buttery smooth!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-sticker-manipulation-toolbar&quot;&gt;New sticker manipulation toolbar&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you select a sticker a toolbar appears allowing you quick access to outline tool, recolor options, flip, arrange etc. It&#x27;s nothing fancy but makes the editor nice and easy to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;haptic-feedback&quot;&gt;Haptic Feedback&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the haptic feedback I added to my Kosmos app so I did something similar here, now as your manipulate the Stickers you can feel little haptic vibrations for every few degrees you rotate, or percentage you scale. It feels really good!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;revenue-cat&quot;&gt;Revenue Cat&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and implemented Revenue Cat a couple of days ago, I couldn&#x27;t believe how simple it made subscription integration. I&#x27;ve always handled subscriptions and in-app purchases myself and it all works fine, but with this I could delete a whole bunch of code, one less thing for me to maintain. It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m considering shifting all my app to use it despite them taking a cut...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-s-next-for-pop-snap&quot;&gt;So what&#x27;s Next for Pop Snap?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text! I had hoped to add this feature this week, but Apple policy team love to faff so i&#x27;ve been playing ping-pong with them all week trying to get the new version accepted. Anyway I think Text would be an awesome feature so that&#x27;s high on my priority list. Also some basic settings to allow default skin colors etc, that will probably be next... I need to get back to on other app&#x27;s now but I&#x27;ll swing back to this in the future, and possibly try to squeeze in some more features on Friday afternoons!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/clackety/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I created a text animation for my &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;projects&#x2F;cosmic&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kosmos app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I wanted a typewritter style effect that could correct itself in realtime -√† la Matrix. It would work well as the user interacts with the astrology charts. The retro-futuristic style fits really well with the vibe of my app and it&#x27;s become part of it&#x27;s identity. I figured I&#x27;d package it up so other people can use it too! So Clackety is available now over on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pub.dev&#x2F;packages&#x2F;clackety&quot;&gt;pub.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the sourcecode is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimmyff&#x2F;clackety&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/cosmic-dev-log-3/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woo, so here we are, Dev Log 3. I said this was going to be a big AI update and wow, I&#x27;ve been blown away by the results I&#x27;ve managed to get with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.google.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gemini&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini an incredibly powerful LLM and simple asking it straight up for interpretations works pretty well, but If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned in the last few weeks is there isn&#x27;t a singe correct way to interpret something in Astrology, there are often various approaches, with different meanings and importance given depending on the astrology tradition, era etc. In order to get a consistent voice &amp;amp; perspective across the app I needed to provide a really thorough astrological context to Gemini. I discovered that by feeding the principles along with the meanings that my app would use, then it would give me consistently accurate and incredibly nuanced results. I&#x27;ve created the concept of an &#x27;AI Astrologer&#x27; on my app, I&#x27;m currently using the Hellenistic AI Astrologer but in the future I can add a Modern Western Astrologer, a Vedic Astroloter, (BaZi, Medievil etc...) and let the user choose what interpretations and principles they desire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with using the cost-effective Gemini Flash 1.5 model but decided that the results I was getting from Gemini Pro 1.5 were worth the additional cost. The were often slightly more creative and really remarkably nuanced. I think Astrology is a great fit for using an LLM, but I could breakdown the interpretations Gemini was providing and trace back pretty much everything to the wealth of astrological data I was feeding it. I played around with various settings but found that using a low Temperature (the balance between predictability 0.0 and creativity 2.0), I found that a value of 0.3 was perfect for my interpretations. I was providing so much context and detail and using a higher score would give Gemini a little more creativity but risked something a little less accurate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results have been nothing less than remarkable, I&#x27;m generating huge amount of interpretations, so many that using anything other than an LLM would not be feasible but as a result there is a staggering amount of depth to each intepretation. I can&#x27;t wait until I get to the point where I am providing a bespoke interpretation for an individual. I plan to do this in phase 2 of the app and if this is an indication of the results then that is going to be wild.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-detour-for-a-comsmic-clock&quot;&gt;A Detour for a Comsmic Clock&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I need to start wrapping things up ...the deadline for submission to the competition is looming. But I had this idea that I really wanted to reproduce the St Marks Cosmic clock that I saw back in 2017 on holiday in Venice. I thought it would be a lovely way to greet the user each time they open the app. I had all the components to do it so I decided I&#x27;d allow myself a little detour to get it made. I soon realised that with this being a digial cosmmic clock, I could go above and beyond what the original clock offered. Like the original I added roman numerals around the edge of the clock that show the time, I would tell the time with the same sun hand, but my sun hand would be based on the sun&#x27;s position on the eclipitc. I added another hand for the moon, again showing it&#x27;s position on the ecliptic but instead of pointing to a roman numeral that pointed to the current moon phase. Both of these hands would also pass through a zodiac ring, showins which sign they were in. I added the AC, MC, DC &amp;amp; IC to show the key points and signs that they&#x27;re in. I created some custom icons for the clock and I think it came out beautifully. I added the same gestural navigation as the astrology charts and it feels really satisfying playing around with it.
Although the clock looked good, it&#x27;s only when I super-charged it with Gemini AI that it transformed in to something really special. My idea was that the confirutation of all this information and then multiplied by the astrological perspective, context and principles as used for the interpretations could then be fed to Gemini to create something based on the precise moment. I call these cosmic moments, and for every cosmic moment Gemini creates a Haiku poem, a thoughful koan-like expression and 3 affirmations. As the moon takes around 27 days to orbit the Earth, it would be in the same phase for up to a few days at time, so I came up with the idea of using the day of the week too. the 7 day week has lots of astrological significance and each day is said to have it&#x27;s own ruler. With Hellenistic Astrology each planet has it&#x27;s themes and also it&#x27;s sect. Adding this as an additional layer means that even while the moonphase gradually shifts, each of the possibly 4 days would have its own unique take on the moments. (Besides, the sun ascendant, sign positions would almost certainly be different too!). The creativity of Gemini has made this my favorite feature of the whole app. I&#x27;m very glag I allowed myself to go on the cosmic clock detour!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scarlet-tides&quot;&gt;Scarlet Tides&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is an example of Gemini&#x27;s creative and poetic side, these were generated with the context that it&#x27;s 4am, the ascendant and the rising sun are both in Cancer. The moon (first quarter phase) is subterranean and it&#x27;s a Tuesday which is ruled by Mars.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;haiku-of-the-moment&quot;&gt;Haiku of the moment&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I embrace the depths of my emotions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I trust the journey unfolding before me.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am safe to express my authentic self.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/cosmic-app-update/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey stargazers! üî≠ I had hoped to do regular dev logs for my Gemini AI competition entry project, but life (and building this app) has been keeping me super busy! But anyway, late is better than never right? And the good news is, the app has come on a ton and I&#x27;m really excited about how it&#x27;s shaping up!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the video above for a walkthrough&#x2F;wafflethrough of the app so far. (Apologies for the rough edges with the vid‚Äì I&#x27;m determined not to do any scripting or post-editing!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-s-what-i-ve-been-up-to&quot;&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been up to&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A buttery smooth interface: You can now shuttle&#x2F;animate through time, location, and even settings (though I turned that off in the video because there&#x27;s a little quirk I need to fix). It feels really tactile with some nice haptic feedback as your rotate the charts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpolation and custom tweens: These make everything super fast and my custom tween sequence keeps the animation calculations nice and accurate.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecliptic and Equatorial positions: Exposing all the data I can such as their coordinates, their sign, house, speed, and distance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspects: The app now shows 11 different aspect types, with intensity calculated based on type, accuracy, speed, and celestial body pairings. (To be fully configurable by the user)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-stuff-i-didn-t-mention-forgot-to-mention-in-the-video&quot;&gt;Bonus stuff I didn&#x27;t mention&#x2F;forgot to mention in the video&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map Projections: After initially using GeoJSON maps I&#x27;ve switched to D3&#x27;s TopoJSON maps and plan to do some really cool stuff with these in the future.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astrology accuracy tests: I&#x27;m making sure all the data that the app is generating is accurate by benchmarking it against external services. I also have an interpolation accuracy test which allows me to understand how far I can interpolate astrological data whilst animating before the accuracy drops below acceptable tolerance levels&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom font: I&#x27;ve drawn a set of astrological symbols (on my tablet) which really help give the app a distinctive look. I plan to write a blog post in the future detailing process and tools used (as a reminder for my future self!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;app-availability&quot;&gt;App Availability&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll be uploading a web version soon and submitting to the app stores by the end of the week (hopefully). So next time you hear from me, you&#x27;ll be able to play with it yourself!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m also considering doing a bit more of a technical deep-dive, let me know if you&#x27;d like to see some of the code behind the scenes. I&#x27;m happy to share a closer look at the Kosmos!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, keep looking up! ‚ú®‚úåÔ∏è&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/building-a-cosmic-app/">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I heard about the Gemini &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.google.dev&#x2F;competition&quot;&gt;AI competition&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; my brain has been whirring. I knew I wanted to build something for it, and I have &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ideas so the problem has been which idea to choose. Earlier this week I finally landed on my idea and I&#x27;m feeling super fired up about it. A couple of months back I bought a lovely little Astrology book (as content and inspiration for &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;projects&#x2F;quest&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a game I&#x27;m working on&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), astrology is totally new to me but I quite liked the idea of exploring birth chart astrology further. I think a great way to explore a subject is to build an app about it (I did this with &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;projects&#x2F;eurovision-app&#x2F;&quot;&gt;my Eurovision app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; back in 2018). I also think it&#x27;s a great fit for the Gemini competition, not only is the clue is in the name but after running a few tests I&#x27;ve found Gemini to provide some really interesting observations on birth chart data. I think I can offer people a much more personal interpretation of their birth chart using the power of generative AI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cosmic-black-rabbit-hole&quot;&gt;The cosmic &lt;del&gt;black&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; rabbit hole&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been down a bit of a rabbit hole for the last couple of days, learning all about space. From transforming geocentric positions (planetary positions as observed from the centre of earth) to topocentric positions (as observed from a point on earth&#x27;s surface), dealing with parallax correction and atmospheric bending of observed positions! It&#x27;s been a lot, but lots of fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-astrology-rabbit-hole&quot;&gt;The Astrology rabbit hole&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve digested a huge amount of Astrology information over the last few days learning everything from the significance of planets, zodiac signs, houses, house systems, zodiac systems, transits, house rulers, placement conditions and we&#x27;re only touching the surface! Throwing myself in to coding an astrology app means no stone can be left unturned! One of the areas that has really caught my interest is that being born in February I&#x27;ve always been told I was an Aquarius, so I assumed I the sun was in the Aquarius sign at the time of my birth, whilst exploring Sidereal Astrology (which is based on the exact placement of stars) I realised the sun was in fact in the Capricorn sign! I&#x27;ve used astrology software to rewind and confirm that this is true! To my current understanding (disclaimer: I&#x27;m now expert -in fact I was a total Astrology novice 3 days ago!) is that Ancient Astrology was based on the stars, a system first created by Babylonian Astrologers. Later Greek Astrologers decided to change the system to ensure that the Sun was at the top of the chart at the Spring Equinox not realising that due to the Earth&#x27;s &quot;wobble&quot;, every 71.6 years the degree the sun appears shifts by 1 degree.  Western Astrology is based on that system (now known as Tropical Astrology) and over the last 2000 years that 1 degree every 70 odd years has added up to around 27 degrees! A 360 degree chart is broken in to 12 segments for each of the Zodiac signs (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ophiuchus_(astrology)&quot;&gt;Ignoring the 13th zodiac sign&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; üòÖ) so each segment is 30 degrees - the Western system is now almost an entire constellation out of sync with the actual stars! Anyway, I could rabbit on about this and numerous other interesting things I&#x27;ve discovered but I&#x27;ll save that waffle for pub chat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gemini-my-ai-coworker&quot;&gt;Gemini: My AI coworker&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge surprise for me is the role that AI has played in this project before I&#x27;;&#x27;ve even started implementing it in to the app. Gemini has been my astronomy &amp;amp; astrology mentor. I&#x27;ve fed it 200+ page documentation PDFs and had it expertly clearing any roadblocks I&#x27;ve come up against. I&#x27;ve been using Gen AI more and more, but never to this extent, I feel like Popeye and Gemini is my Spinach! I can&#x27;t wait actually start implementing the chart interpretation stuff next. Feels like I&#x27;ve made a heap of progress in super short time -I can&#x27;t wait see where this goes!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/next-generation-of-my-dating-apps/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m super happy to be able to say that the first app using my next generation dating platform is now available in both &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.onescene.app&quot;&gt;Goolge Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; store and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;one-scene-dating-friends&#x2F;id6443775589&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;ve launched one of my brands &#x27;One Scene&#x27; using the new platform. This will be a bit of a test before I start moving over the bigger brands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been a long road to getting here so I&#x27;ll quickly get you up to speed...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-rocketware-dating-apps&quot;&gt;A brief history of Rocketware &amp;amp; dating apps&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created my company Rocketware back in 2011. My company&#x27;s first product was a white label dating platform called &#x27;Datingnode&#x27;. I built it around the LGBTQI+ community and it&#x27;s been steadily ticking over for the last 13 years. Almost 6 million members have registered over the years and about half of those are currently active on the platform. Over the years Datingnode has provided dating services for some great brands, GT (UK&#x27;s biggest gay lifestyle magazine), DIVA (UK&#x27;s largest lesbian lifestyle magazine), Pink Paper (UK LGBTQI+ news portal &amp;amp; newspaper), GayXchange (dating TV channel) as well as my only brands including Only Women and Only Lads that are reasonably well known within the LGBTQI+ community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datingnode was initially launched as a white label dating solution for dating websites. It was 2011 and websites were still king. Only a year later everything changed when Tinder launched, the dating industry evolved over night. Over the years there have been various iterations of Datingnode:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011: Datingnode white label platform launches&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012: Datingnode apps available in app stores utilising Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator to wrap Javascript web apps&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016: New API alongside native Android and Native Objective-C iOS apps released&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017: New website launches built upon the 2016 API.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018-2020: Developed new Angular Dart PWA (Progressive web app), although this app never saw the light of day!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020-2023: Developed new entirely new dating product which is what I&#x27;ve launched this week.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(TODO: Add screenshots here)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thinking-so-what-happened-to-the-2018-app&quot;&gt;ü§î So what happened to the 2018 app?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I started creating and new dating app built on the Datingnode API. The app was written in Angular and it interfaced with the API by an SDK that was generated from the Datingnode JSON API specification file. To help me on this project I took on a senior very experienced developer for around 18 months. This would be my first commercial Dart project and having someone on-board that has written battle-hardened dart code was reassuring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slogged away at it for almost 2 years, the app came together and when it did I was pretty proud of it -it really was a very accomplished web app. A week or two away from launch I took the very difficult decision to not launch it and throw away the huge investment that my company had made in to it over the last 24 months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning sat in my co-working space and I was trying to wrap up those loose-ends. I didn&#x27;t feel good about launching the app and I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on why. I then had a crazy thought -&quot;What start all over again&quot; -and I didn&#x27;t mean just the client app, I mean the whole shebang... Reinvent Datingnode from the ground up. The moment this idea had entered my head it was over all for the Angular client and Datingnode too. I felt terrible about the wasted money but I felt hugely relieved, I knew that launching another Datingnode app was subscribing me to another 5+ years of Datingnode. Datingnode had grown long in the tooth, it&#x27;s API was huge and complex. It was the very definition of a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monolithic_application&quot;&gt;monoalithic app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it ran on physical servers and them breaking would often ruin weekends, evenings even holidays! Maybe it was a case of the grass is greener but I had already mentally taken the leap, I was invested in the idea of starting with a clean slate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;Clean slate cartoon&quot; title=&quot;Clean slate cartoon&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;clean-slate.3960eea5d3f7a5e2.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;clean-slate.c0822469b8828473.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;clean-slate.3960eea5d3f7a5e2.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ü§£ I keep this in mind whenever I start a new project -to remind myself not to fall in to the trap!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reimaging-my-dating-product-10-years-later&quot;&gt;Reimaging my dating product 10 years later&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the fact I&#x27;ve just wasted 2 years of work and paid a rockstar developers salary for 18 months, I was in a pretty privileged position. I had a relatively passive income and a bit of a runway to re-imagine my dating product. Here are the ideologies I came up with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developed for the cloud&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: I wanted my dev-ops to be mostly someone elses problem. Not only would I utilise cloud technology I would design for it. I would utilise managed services where I could to maximise redundancy and security. Yes you pay a premium for the fancy technology but I&#x27;m a strong believe in do what you you do well, and for me that&#x27;s making software, not settings up and maintaining the infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Properly Gender inclusion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The vast majority of dating services that are available today handle gender-identity inclusion poorly. Even if they let users choose their gender identity it still comes down to binary male or female when it comes to the matching. To support gender-identities properly the service needs to be designed around this concept - not just adapted to it. On my new dating service, gender identities are treated equally not as subsets of male or female.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutual likes to chat&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Thank you Tinder, this is one of the two great innovations we have Tinder to thank. The principle that both parties must be interested in one-another before communication can happen solves many problems with traditional dating services. It also is a great way to stop the service being abused by spammers and (unsophisticated) bots. This would be baked in to my new dating experience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modern UI built with Flutter&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: I knew straight away that Flutter to build my new app. As a Dart developer this was the current hotness and it would allow me to have Android and iOS apps built from a single codebase. It also meant I could deploy Dart services in the cloud and they could all share the same code base. Dart is the language endgame for me and I&#x27;m living the developer dream -a single technology stack (front-end and back-end). In terms of user experience I will incorporate Tinder&#x27;s other great innovation - the gestural swipe system for sifting through potential matches.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;One does not simply launch a new dating app&quot; title=&quot;One does not simply launch a new dating app&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;boromir.2d3cc1265e7b93ac.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;boromir.b46a1e33364538cb.webp 512w&quot; class=&quot;framed&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tip-of-the-iceberg&quot;&gt;The tip of the iceberg&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought a Dating platform a bit like an iceberg (or ant-hill), the bit people see (the app) makes up about 10% of the project. The other 90% is the customer service tools, the moderation systems, the anti-scam systems, billing systems, the notification systems, marketing etc etc. As I was starting with a clean-slate and new technology stack I&#x27;ve had to rebuild all the tools again. Using the single tech stack and shared code base has been a huge help here. I&#x27;ve created some cloud orchestration tools that allow semi-automated testing and deployment of my cloud-endpoints. The new platform has around 50 cloud endpoints &#x2F; micro-services - handling everything from registration to AI photo moderation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve created a new management tool and moderation tools using Flutter however this time they&#x27;re targeting the web giving remote workers easy access using their browser. There&#x27;s more work to do on this front but the initial tooling is more than adequate for launch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;launch-plan&quot;&gt;Launch plan&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-term goal is to transfer the traffic and revenue from the old Datingnode platform on to the new platform. Hopefully this will happen within 12 months but I&#x27;m prepared for it to take longer than my estimate (things usually do!). Once I&#x27;ve established the new platform I&#x27;ll look at retiring the old platform. I will be popping a large bottle of fizz the day I turn off the old servers! It&#x27;s going to be a busy year or two but massively exciting. So cheers everyone, I&#x27;ve waiting a long time to let my new dating apps in to wild and today they&#x27;re available for you all to download! üéâ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download One Scene on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.onescene.app&quot;&gt;Android&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;one-scene-dating-friends&#x2F;id6443775589&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days/">&lt;p&gt;During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I&#x27;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a ¬£38.99 p&#x2F;year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days&#x2F;photo_that_started_it_all.gif&quot; alt=&quot;GIF&quot; title=&quot;The photo that started it all!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, on the very long &amp;amp; hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of ¬£2.99, pay once &amp;amp; own forever. I&#x27;m sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;




&lt;img alt=&quot;Sticker Party logo&quot; title=&quot;Sticker Party logo&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.78fb61e172f71cc5.webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.37b1f643260560b0.webp 512w, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimmyff.co.uk&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;sticker_party.78fb61e172f71cc5.webp 1024w&quot; class=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I&#x27;ll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I&#x27;ll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download Sticker Party on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=uk.rocketware.stickerparty&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;sticker-party&#x2F;id1634193331&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Please help get the ball rolling and give it a good rating! üòâ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
