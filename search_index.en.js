I'm an obsessive creator, an avid gamer, dedicated rower, and a fun loving dog dad. Befitting my favorite era, this is my little den on the internet (don't forget to sign my guestbook ;). Herein you will find some of my projects and a bit of an insight in to my scatterbrain (see blog). This website is first and foremost for me, it serves as a little diary which gives me a bit of record of the stuff I was up to many moons ago!\n\nAnalogue &amp; digital gaming\nGaming is one of my cornerstones, probably as I find non-interactive activities pretty boring! I love table top gaming as a way of gathering friends and family around a table and having a great joint experience (feel free to connect on BoardGameGeek). I love to design board games and I've dabbled with video game development too. I'm a passionate gamer although I don't get much time for video games these days but I remain a die hard Nintendo fan-boy.\n\nCoding &amp; technology\nYou can find my public projects over on my Github profile. I'm always creating something new! My main language is Dart, I'm in love with the Flutter framework. I'm also trying to level up my Rust skills. I'm a big fan of serverless technology and my preferred backend is Google Cloud. Oh and I use Nix btw (my nixfiles).\n\nCreative arts\nI always have some creative endeavour on the go, you can check out the gallery to see some of the things I've made. Some of the mediums include getting messy with clay doing ceramics, playing around with my tablet creating digital art and making a mess with oil paints. I also enjoy to practice yoga and I usually get involved with the Inktober challenge!\n\nMy work &amp; apps\nI run a small independant company called Rocketware.

I wanted to see how much I could strip back to get TUI vibes: fast, lightweight with zero bloat.\nThis weekend I finally built Zap, an ultra-minimal theme for Zola (the wonderful Rust-based static site generator). It's designed to be as minimal as possible while still being functional: light/dark mode toggle, optional inline SVG icons via a sprite sheet, responsive images, and vibrant OKLCH colors. The entire base CSS is inlined in the HTML—no external stylesheet requests. I also replaced the old search index with Fuse.js, which generates a significantly smaller index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison showing (from left) the old Inky theme and Zap dark + light mode.\n\nDoes it live up to its name?\nPerfect scores from PageSpeed Insights! 100 across the board for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Analytics\nI took the opportunity to add support for Umami analytics.

After moving to Nix full-time, my initial setup meant updating everything at once: AI tools, developer tooling, and my desktop environment. This got annoying fast, since I like to update AI stuff almost daily, dev tools weekly, and my desktop maybe monthly.\nI split my nixpkgs into specialized inputs (pkgs-ai, pkgs-dev-tools, pkgs-desktop) so I could update them independently, but I had no easy way to see which inputs actually had updates available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I created a little nushell script called flake-freshness that checks my inputs and shows what needs updating. It compares my flake.lock versions against upstream, caches the results to avoid repeated nix eval calls.\nI run it on system startup so I get a quick overview before deciding what to update. It's made managing multiple inputs a lot less of a chore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy entire Nix config, including other scripts like this, is available on GitHub: github.com/jimmyff/nixfiles. Stay Fresh! 🦑\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/beyond-package-management-how-nix-refactored-my-digital-life/","title":"Beyond package management: How Nix refactored my digital life","body":"(You can find my Nix config over on Github)\nI'm a disorganised person. My workflow is to bounce around a codebase for days/weeks at a time and when I come up for air I'll usually have left a slew of configs, tools, scripts, repos scattered around my computer like the socks near the bed, or the pile of paperwork on my desk. After a while I reach a point where it all becomes unmanageable. I'll wade on (unproductively) until I can't go any further, then reset my laptop and spend a week reconfiguring the system, tooling, and getting projects running again. So when I discovered Nix (about 12 months back) it sounded too good to be true: a declarative package manager with reproducible builds and pinned package versions. Even better, NixOS applies these principles to your entire operating system! I was incredibly excited by it but then got horrendously bogged down in my first system config. I shelved it as something to come back to when I had more time. Several months later I gave it another try and spent the time needed to understand how to properly configure it. Result? Well let's just say I'm never going back -boy oh boy, Nix is wild! In this post, I'll walk you through my journey: reviving an old Pixelbook with NixOS, wrangling my MacBook with nix-darwin, and super-charging Nix with AI to solve a problem I thought was unsolvable.\nNixOS on an old Pixelbook\nI gave Nix a second chance as I had a slow old Pixelbook Go (2017 Chromebook that I'd picked-up cheap on ebay). It frustrated me how sluggish it was despite being reasonably well-specced. I disabled the BIOS write protection (using the excellent guides at MrChromebox) and replaced it with Coreboot, an open-source BIOS that allowed me to install NixOS (the process was more involved than expected, requiring me to physically disconnect the battery to disable write protection!). Getting a simple NixOS system running was simple and I was instantly blown away by the speed! The Pixelbook (now a Nixelbook) had never felt so snappy -it was a joy to use. I've not used Linux on the desktop for almost 15 years (I started on Linux in the early 2000s with Debian Woody and remember the hype around Ubuntu Warty Warthog!) so I had great fun playing around with all the cool new stuff -especially the display managers! Everything worked remarkably well except the parts specific to the Pixelbook: The AI assistant button, the function key row and the speakers. I've almost got everything working now -more on this later!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Nix on my macbook\nThe Nixelbook was a triumph, but could I apply this same magic to my daily driver, a chaotic M1 MacBook Pro? My system is a mess; way too much stuff, brew packages, countless dev projects, tooling and SDKs installed globally. I'm also never quite sure about the correct way to fully purge something on macOS (especially if it's been installed via an installer). Enter Nix: I can now enable those configurations I setup for my NixOS laptop on a per-module basis for my macbook. The macOS version of Nix configuration is handled by nix-darwin, which has some differences and gotchas due to macOS's BSD Unix foundation versus Linux. Also I'm running an Apple silicon macbook pro- so the packages I use need to have aarch64-darwin builds (which most do). With a little bit of patience you can configure your various hosts and share your nix modules across systems with different architectures. This for me is huge: I can have a dependable, reproducible configuration, I am in control of every aspect, and every configuration is deliberate, considered and under version control.\nDeclarative Dev Environments\nI've previously used Ansible for dev-ops configuration, it's powerful but also painful. I found that it would be overkill for my smaller projects, and it certainly wouldn't be good for configuring desktop tooling etc. The NixOS package repository with pinned versions is the HUGE differentiator for me. I'm not at the stage of configuring cloud containers with NixOS (that will be a challenge for another day), but for local development environments this is massive. For this, I use Nix Flakes. Flakes are the modern way to package Nix expressions, locking all dependencies for true reproducibility. I configure my projects as Nix Flakes that checkout the code, provide utility scripts and configure the environment by installing SDKs (pinned to specific version) and any tooling required. With direnv, the entire environment appears when entering a project directory and disappears when leaving: SDKs, running services, tooling, even IDEs if desired. Doing something like this, supporting different system architectures with Ansible would be a nightmare (and far beyond my ability!). As I can now reproduce my configurations I'm leaning heavily in to nushell as my default shell environment, and I've created a couple of nuscripts (gm.nu and dartboard.nu) to manage my bigger projects, handling everything from batch-updating and running tests across various projects to syncing and managing git submodules in mono-repos. My flakes (example) can enable these global scripts, and I have them configured to give me a project overview each time the flake is loaded. I'm willing to spend longer creating the perfect dev environment as now it's reproducible, my utility tools and scripts can be shared among projects and I'm seeing qualitative improvements to my developer experience because of it.\nNix + AI = 🤯\nMy biggest challenge was the Nixelbook's audio. After replacing the firmware, I discovered the audio drivers were unavailable -a dead end that others online had hit with no success. I'd failed miserably trying to fix it myself. As a last resort, I decided to see if an AI could help me crack it. I tasked Claude Code with the problem and the results were astonishing -I watched as the AI assistant (under close supervision) methodically tried various approaches while monitoring system logs and working through errors I probably would never have discovered. Eventually it(/we?) managed to locate the final piece of the puzzle: the speakers topology file (that someone had recovered from the ChromeOS recovery image) which with some impressive nix configuration literally brought music to my ears (if you have a Pixelbook Go/Chromebook Atlas, help yourself to the solution here!).\nWhat's next &amp; final thoughts\nEarlier this year Google released 'Linux Terminal' which provides a virtualized Linux environment on Android, of course there is already Nix support. I'm going to configure my Pixel phone as a host in my nix config which will give me a fully-fledged, perfectly configured Linux OS in my pocket- everything setup just the way I like it. I could also play with using Nix as a tool for configuring cloud infrastructure -something I would like to explore further down the road.\nMy closing comment is that Nix has blown me away. It's refactored my chaotic digital life in to something well structured, thoughtfully considered, reproducible and dependable, and I'm reaping the rewards of all of this already. I urge everyone to take a look at Nix and give it the time it deserves; you can thank me later (over in my guestbook!).\n\ngithub.com/jimmyff/nixfiles/\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/prism-dart-flutter-color-package/","title":"Prism: Color Library for Dart & Flutter","body":"\nPrism is an optimized, zero-dependency color manipulation library for Dart &amp; Flutter with multiple color models, accessibility tools, and pre-built palettes.\n\nI've always been fascinated with colors and color theory. I've designed a board game and an app around it, and in my amateur artworks I seem to subconsciously gravitate to complementary palettes (examples: 1, 2, 3). Over the years I've written a couple of unpublished color libraries. The first was Chroma which I later replaced with Pigment, which I rebranded as Prism due to a name clash. The rebrand gave me a good excuse to spend a bit of time refactoring it and polishing it. I'm pleased to announce Prism is now available over on pub.dev and github. While the concepts aren't new, Prism is a comprehensive and thoughtfully designed package that makes working with modern color spaces in Dart really easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✨ Back in 2015 I spotted this orange and blue banding on my tablet's screen providing a little real-world demonstration of the color theory that I was reading about! 🧡💙\n\n\nTo understand what makes prism useful I need to briefly explain color spaces. These are systems for describing and storing colors:\nRGB - The Color Model of Screens\nYour phone or laptop screen creates colors by mixing light. Each pixel is made of tiny red, green, and blue sub-pixels (RGB). If all are off, you get black; if all are on full, you get white. This is great for screens, but it's not very intuitive for humans.\nIf you want to make a color lighter or change its hue, you're just fiddling with Red, Green, and Blue values. Worse, if you try to create a gradient between two colors in RGB, you often get a muddy, greyish color in the middle. This is because the math of RGB doesn't match up with how our eyes actually perceive color and lightness.\nColor spaces like HSL and HSV were created to make manipulating RGB colors easier. However, they are fundamentally flawed, as their handling of lightness and value is inconsistent across different hues.\nOklab + Oklch - A More Human Approach\nThis is the problem Oklab and Oklch are designed to solve. They are modern color spaces built around how humans perceive color, focusing on three things:\n\nL - Lightness (how light or dark it appears)\nC - Chroma (how vibrant or intense the color is)\nH - Hue (the actual color, like red, green, blue)\n\nThe magic is that \"Lightness\" in Oklch is perceptually uniform. This means you can change the hue or chroma and the perceived lightness won't change. This is a game-changer for creating accessible UIs with proper contrast, and for creating beautiful, vibrant gradients that don't turn to mud.\nWhile the math behind this is complex (I used the brilliant formulas from Björn Ottosson's post to handle gamut clipping), but Prism abstracts all that away.\n\nHopefully the above gives you a little overview of why a dedicated color library is useful. Prism provides a really easy way to create, manipulate and store colors. Prism currently supports Rgb8, Rgb16, Hsl, Hsv, Oklch and Oklab color spaces, and makes it trivial to convert between them. Here's a little example:\n\nNotice that the final rgb hex color (format: #RRGGBB) actually has a bit of green and blue to create the darker red.\nPalettes\nPrism also has a palette system, this allows developers to have palettes with pre-calculated luminosity levels with RGB or OKLCH colors (this is particularly useful when working with RGB palettes as runtime calculations can be expensive). The palette sources can be pre-defined such as Material Colors, Open Colors, Tailwind or can be pre-computed using Prism (the Prism palette is called Spectrum). Spectrum builds on the Google's Material Colors system (which offers shades from 50-900 in multiple colors) but expands it at both ends to offer shades from 0-1000 giving more choice at the extremes of the spectrum, great for doing really light/dark themes. I've also expanded the color choices with hues at 15° intervals around the color wheel. The result is a palette with more nuance at the lightest and darkest extremes, as you can see in the comparison below:\n\n\nAs a little bonus all the palettes are compiled to css and available on github in both RGB and OKLCH formats.\nWhat's next\nI've not finished porting over the Pigment library to Prism, there is still the color theory code to migrate. I use color theory to calculate palettes based on images by extracting the dominant colors and choosing aesthetically pleasing combinations of colors. Before I port this over I need to consider my approach as at the moment prism and prism_flutter require zero dependencies and i'd like to keep them that way. I'll probably add a prism_image_analysis package at some point which will have the package:image package dependency.\n\nYou can find Prism on pub.dev and github. Prism Flutter is also available on pub.dev and github.\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/pop-snap-update/","title":"Pop Snap Mega Update","body":"So the latest version of Pop Snap has just hit the app stores so I figured it was the perfect time to add some deets about it to my blog. This is the result of about 2 weeks work totally revamping the client app. I've rewritten the editor itself which has big optimisation benefits and loads of scope for further development. I had an idea late last year that I would use Gemini LLM to categorise stickers for me. I implemented that back in September and I detailed the process with a youtube a dev log which is included below. I've since had some help loading SVG assets (stickers) in to the system for gemini to churn through and we now have almost 20k stickers in the system! Anyway, I'll include more details below, but if you're tight for time, just go and download the app and have a play!\nNew App Store Screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an AI super-powered control-panel\nI built a CMS which allows me to bulk upload SVG assets in to the system, sanitize them, tag the colors and then process them by generating metadata with AI. I won't go in to too much detail as I've gone through most of it in the devlog video below:\n\n\nNew Features\nAsset Pipeline System\nOne of the big optimisations of the new version is an asset pipeline system which rasterizes the SVG graphic (with the colors, styling options required) and then feeds the back to the flutter UI, it re-renders this as the user scales and manipulates the asset. It's a pretty cool system and makes the UI buttery smooth!\nNew sticker manipulation toolbar\nNow when you select a sticker a toolbar appears allowing you quick access to outline tool, recolor options, flip, arrange etc. It's nothing fancy but makes the editor nice and easy to use.\nHaptic Feedback\nI loved the haptic feedback I added to my Kosmos app so I did something similar here, now as your manipulate the Stickers you can feel little haptic vibrations for every few degrees you rotate, or percentage you scale. It feels really good!\nRevenue Cat\nI downloaded and implemented Revenue Cat a couple of days ago, I couldn't believe how simple it made subscription integration. I've always handled subscriptions and in-app purchases myself and it all works fine, but with this I could delete a whole bunch of code, one less thing for me to maintain. It's so good I'm considering shifting all my app to use it despite them taking a cut...\n\nSo what's Next for Pop Snap?\nText! I had hoped to add this feature this week, but Apple policy team love to faff so i've been playing ping-pong with them all week trying to get the new version accepted. Anyway I think Text would be an awesome feature so that's high on my priority list. Also some basic settings to allow default skin colors etc, that will probably be next... I need to get back to on other app's now but I'll swing back to this in the future, and possibly try to squeeze in some more features on Friday afternoons!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/fake-cultist/","title":"Fake Cultists: Development Diary & Sell Sheet","body":"Almost a year back I blogged about my new social deduction game. Since then the games seen a couple of fairly chunky changes and I've been gradually refining it ever since. With every iteration the play tests became smoother and the game simpler. I think that this might be my first game I actually think is ready to publish! This is uncharted territory for me -I feel like there is nothing more that I can really add or take away from the game. I'm sure there will be a little tweaking to the balance (at various player counts) but essentially the concept has been been fully realised and it actually stands-up to my expectations! It's a tight little game with a juicy little deduction puzzle!\nThe Elevator Pitch\nWhen you pitch your game to publishers, often they want to see a 'Sell Sheet'.

I've never really considered how I'd feel about handing a game over to a publisher but now I'm starting on that journey I'm feeling a little protective over it! I've quite a lot of ideas about how I'd like it producing such as using black core for the box, game cards and tokens to give it a gothic vibe and spot printing with neons inks to give it a super striking table presence! The way something looks and feels is really important to me and relinquishing that control might be a challenge! Anyway, it's very early days and publishers might not be interested my little game!

I said this was going to be a big AI update and wow, I've been blown away by the results I've managed to get with Gemini!\n\nGemini Interpretations\nGemini an incredibly powerful LLM and simple asking it straight up for interpretations works pretty well, but If there's one thing I've learned in the last few weeks is there isn't a singe correct way to interpret something in Astrology, there are often various approaches, with different meanings and importance given depending on the astrology tradition, era etc. In order to get a consistent voice &amp; perspective across the app I needed to provide a really thorough astrological context to Gemini. I discovered that by feeding the principles along with the meanings that my app would use, then it would give me consistently accurate and incredibly nuanced results. I've created the concept of an 'AI Astrologer' on my app, I'm currently using the Hellenistic AI Astrologer but in the future I can add a Modern Western Astrologer, a Vedic Astroloter, (BaZi, Medievil etc...) and let the user choose what interpretations and principles they desire.\nI experimented with using the cost-effective Gemini Flash 1.5 model but decided that the results I was getting from Gemini Pro 1.5 were worth the additional cost. The were often slightly more creative and really remarkably nuanced. I think Astrology is a great fit for using an LLM, but I could breakdown the interpretations Gemini was providing and trace back pretty much everything to the wealth of astrological data I was feeding it. I played around with various settings but found that using a low Temperature (the balance between predictability 0.0 and creativity 2.0), I found that a value of 0.3 was perfect for my interpretations. I was providing so much context and detail and using a higher score would give Gemini a little more creativity but risked something a little less accurate.\nThe results have been nothing less than remarkable, I'm generating huge amount of interpretations, so many that using anything other than an LLM would not be feasible but as a result there is a staggering amount of depth to each intepretation. I can't wait until I get to the point where I am providing a bespoke interpretation for an individual. I plan to do this in phase 2 of the app and if this is an indication of the results then that is going to be wild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Detour for a Comsmic Clock\nI know I need to start wrapping things up ...the deadline for submission to the competition is looming. But I had this idea that I really wanted to reproduce the St Marks Cosmic clock that I saw back in 2017 on holiday in Venice. I thought it would be a lovely way to greet the user each time they open the app. I had all the components to do it so I decided I'd allow myself a little detour to get it made. I soon realised that with this being a digial cosmmic clock, I could go above and beyond what the original clock offered. Like the original I added roman numerals around the edge of the clock that show the time, I would tell the time with the same sun hand, but my sun hand would be based on the sun's position on the eclipitc. I added another hand for the moon, again showing it's position on the ecliptic but instead of pointing to a roman numeral that pointed to the current moon phase. Both of these hands would also pass through a zodiac ring, showins which sign they were in. I added the AC, MC, DC &amp; IC to show the key points and signs that they're in. I created some custom icons for the clock and I think it came out beautifully. I added the same gestural navigation as the astrology charts and it feels really satisfying playing around with it.\nAlthough the clock looked good, it's only when I super-charged it with Gemini AI that it transformed in to something really special. My idea was that the confirutation of all this information and then multiplied by the astrological perspective, context and principles as used for the interpretations could then be fed to Gemini to create something based on the precise moment. I call these cosmic moments, and for every cosmic moment Gemini creates a Haiku poem, a thoughful koan-like expression and 3 affirmations. As the moon takes around 27 days to orbit the Earth, it would be in the same phase for up to a few days at time, so I came up with the idea of using the day of the week too. the 7 day week has lots of astrological significance and each day is said to have it's own ruler. With Hellenistic Astrology each planet has it's themes and also it's sect. Adding this as an additional layer means that even while the moonphase gradually shifts, each of the possibly 4 days would have its own unique take on the moments. (Besides, the sun ascendant, sign positions would almost certainly be different too!). The creativity of Gemini has made this my favorite feature of the whole app. I'm very glag I allowed myself to go on the cosmic clock detour!\n\nScarlet Tides\nHere is an example of Gemini's creative and poetic side, these were generated with the context that it's 4am, the ascendant and the rising sun are both in Cancer. The moon (first quarter phase) is subterranean and it's a Tuesday which is ruled by Mars.\nHaiku of the moment\n\nThought of the moment\n\nWithout the Moon's reflection, how can we truly know the Sun's fire?\n\nAffirmations of the moment\n\nI embrace the depths of my emotions.\nI trust the journey unfolding before me.\nI am safe to express my authentic self.\n\n\nI'll end that with those lovely inspiring messages, until next time - keeping look up! ✨\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/cosmic-app-update/","title":"Announcing Kosmos! // Dev Log 2","body":"Hey stargazers! 🔭 I had hoped to do regular dev logs for my Gemini AI competition entry project, but life (and building this app) has been keeping me super busy!

It feels really tactile with some nice haptic feedback as your rotate the charts.\nInterpolation and custom tweens: These make everything super fast and my custom tween sequence keeps the animation calculations nice and accurate.\nEcliptic and Equatorial positions: Exposing all the data I can such as their coordinates, their sign, house, speed, and distance.\nAspects: The app now shows 11 different aspect types, with intensity calculated based on type, accuracy, speed, and celestial body pairings. (To be fully configurable by the user)\n\nBonus stuff I didn't mention/forgot to mention in the video\n\nMap Projections: After initially using GeoJSON maps I've switched to D3's TopoJSON maps and plan to do some really cool stuff with these in the future.\nAstrology accuracy tests: I'm making sure all the data that the app is generating is accurate by benchmarking it against external services. I also have an interpolation accuracy test which allows me to understand how far I can interpolate astrological data whilst animating before the accuracy drops below acceptable tolerance levels\nCustom font: I've drawn a set of astrological symbols (on my tablet) which really help give the app a distinctive look. I plan to write a blog post in the future detailing process and tools used (as a reminder for my future self!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Availability\nI'll be uploading a web version soon and submitting to the app stores by the end of the week (hopefully). So next time you hear from me, you'll be able to play with it yourself!\nI'm also considering doing a bit more of a technical deep-dive, let me know if you'd like to see some of the code behind the scenes. I'm happy to share a closer look at the Kosmos!\nUntil then, keep looking up! ✨✌️\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/building-a-cosmic-app/","title":"Decoding the Stars with AI // Dev Log 1","body":"Ever since I heard about the Gemini AI competition my brain has been whirring. I knew I wanted to build something for it, and I have lots ideas so the problem has been which idea to choose. Earlier this week I finally landed on my idea and I'm feeling super fired up about it. A couple of months back I bought a lovely little Astrology book (as content and inspiration for a game I'm working on), astrology is totally new to me but I quite liked the idea of exploring birth chart astrology further. I think a great way to explore a subject is to build an app about it (I did this with my Eurovision app back in 2018). I also think it's a great fit for the Gemini competition, not only is the clue is in the name but after running a few tests I've found Gemini to provide some really interesting observations on birth chart data. I think I can offer people a much more personal interpretation of their birth chart using the power of generative AI.\n\nThe cosmic black rabbit hole\nI've been down a bit of a rabbit hole for the last couple of days, learning all about space. From transforming geocentric positions (planetary positions as observed from the centre of earth) to topocentric positions (as observed from a point on earth's surface), dealing with parallax correction and atmospheric bending of observed positions! It's been a lot, but lots of fun.\nThe Astrology rabbit hole\nI've digested a huge amount of Astrology information over the last few days learning everything from the significance of planets, zodiac signs, houses, house systems, zodiac systems, transits, house rulers, placement conditions and we're only touching the surface! Throwing myself in to coding an astrology app means no stone can be left unturned! One of the areas that has really caught my interest is that being born in February I've always been told I was an Aquarius, so I assumed I the sun was in the Aquarius sign at the time of my birth, whilst exploring Sidereal Astrology (which is based on the exact placement of stars) I realised the sun was in fact in the Capricorn sign! I've used astrology software to rewind and confirm that this is true! To my current understanding (disclaimer: I'm now expert -in fact I was a total Astrology novice 3 days ago!) is that Ancient Astrology was based on the stars, a system first created by Babylonian Astrologers. Later Greek Astrologers decided to change the system to ensure that the Sun was at the top of the chart at the Spring Equinox not realising that due to the Earth's \"wobble\", every 71.6 years the degree the sun appears shifts by 1 degree. Western Astrology is based on that system (now known as Tropical Astrology) and over the last 2000 years that 1 degree every 70 odd years has added up to around 27 degrees! A 360 degree chart is broken in to 12 segments for each of the Zodiac signs (Ignoring the 13th zodiac sign 😅) so each segment is 30 degrees - the Western system is now almost an entire constellation out of sync with the actual stars! Anyway, I could rabbit on about this and numerous other interesting things I've discovered but I'll save that waffle for pub chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGemini: My AI coworker\nThe huge surprise for me is the role that AI has played in this project before I';'ve even started implementing it in to the app. Gemini has been my astronomy &amp; astrology mentor. I've fed it 200+ page documentation PDFs and had it expertly clearing any roadblocks I've come up against. I've been using Gen AI more and more, but never to this extent, I feel like Popeye and Gemini is my Spinach! I can't wait actually start implementing the chart interpretation stuff next. Feels like I've made a heap of progress in super short time -I can't wait see where this goes!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/castle-grayskull/","title":"By the Power of Grayskull!","body":"I've been getting super nostalgic for Masters of the Universe recently after pledging for a big skirmish game on crowd funding (Clash of Eternia). I adore a skirmish games (War Cry being my favorite) and this colourful and camp universe is so much more appealing to me than Warhammer's Grimdark. To scratch the itch of my excitement I've re-watched all of the tv series, bought the comics collection and huuuge encyclopedia. I also bought this very cool dice tower for a different MoTU skirmish game which I figured I could use with my game when it eventually arrives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dice tower arrived in a few big grey plastic sprues and I glued it all together pretty badly as this left lots of gaps for me to fill with green stuff. I undercoated the whole thing in alien purple and went for a nice contrasty green to make it all pop!\n\n\nI think it came out great. Can't wait for the game to arrive now!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/cultist-deduction-game/","title":"Fake cultists... A game of social deduction","body":"I've always loved social deduction games like Avalon, love letter, Battlestar Galactica, Coup and Werewolf. After playing a load of them at Airecon I was inspired to have a go created my own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Settings / Background\n\nIn a daring escape, innocent prisoners slip in to the robes of cultists and join a procession marching out of the castle. They soon realise the cultists are marching to the crypt to resurrect the dark lord. If successful the dark lord will summon an unstoppable army of undead. Can the escapees maintain their disguise for long enough to thwart the resurrection and save humanity from the clutches of impending doom?\n\nThe Game\nThe players follow a route on a map which will see them completing three tests of fealty and then interrogating two groups of cultists. In the last round they choose a final team of cultists to perform (or sabotage) the Resurrection! The escapees (fake cultists) will be trying to thwart the fealty tests attempts to earn holy relics to aid in the final resurrection -all whilst keeping their identities hidden. The real cultists will be trying to deduce who are the escapees and who their fellow loyal cultists are!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspirations\nAvalon is one of my all time favourite games, with the right group it consistently results in a fantastic play. Avalon sees elected groups going on 'quests', my game has a similar concept in the form of the fealty tests although I add a twist in the form of skills and an overseer. The inspiration for skills comes from 'Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game' (the daddy mac of social deduction games) but I simplified it so each character has access to 2 of the 3 skills: Life, Death &amp; Faith. Skills add a nice and simple extra layer of depth to the game.\nImperfect information\nGames like 'Feed the Kraken' fall down (for me) as they involve players having perfect information, in some situations players know if another player is telling the truth or not. In my game I want to avoid that making sure all the information is filtered through an elected player (the 'Test Overseer' or the 'Interrogator'). That player always receives results from two or more cultists so they never truly know how an individual acted -unless of course all the results were the same (In BSG a random card is added to the results which is their way of introducing a little chaos). That elected player might have reason to manipulate the results or not share the full information with the group - another juicy puzzle piece in the deduction game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first playtest\nI took the game along to a group that I've played with for years, I fully expected us to only manage a round or two however everyone was having so much fun with it they insisted that we finish it! I got some great takeaways but most importantly everyone seemed to have lots of fun - this usually never happens with a first playtest (for me at least!). The game took about an hour and during each of the 6 rounds there was lots of discussions (sometimes a little too lively!). I hoped with the imperfect information it wouldn't be confrontational but I think with that group being comfortable with each other they were happy to push the banter! I'll be interested to monitor how confrontational it is with future groups. On the last round (the Resurrection), it could have gone ether way but the real cultists managed to deduce the escapees just in time! Overall I was really happy with how it played and everyone said they really enjoyed it.\nWhat's next?\nLots and lots more playtesting. If it still holds up then I will consider how I can release it. I'm considering the possibility of it being a little print and play game. I think it fills a little bit of a gap of being a juicy little social deduction game, with more depth than Avalon but plays a lot quicker than Battlestar Galactica. It would also serve as a great way to raise awareness for my Ultimate Quest game!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/ultimate-quest-first-public-playtest/","title":"Ultimate Quest - The first public playtest!","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year at Airecon I booked a playtest slot for my game Ultimate Quest. I've been working on the game heavily for the last 6-8 months and knowing that Airecon was coming up had given me a date that I knew I needed to have the first Quest fully playable. I was seeing it as a deadline to create a vertical slice of the game (the whole game but with only enough content for a single adventure) so I could determine if it will play anything like the game I have in my head.\nDespite my impending deadline I still made a huge last minute change to the game. At a Leeds Playtesting group some fellow designers gave me some feedback that I'd already heard before and had been playing on my mind. They said we love the concept (Dungeon Crawl X Yahtzee) but execution doesn't push the yahtzee dice play far enough. Hearing this again solidified that I needed to take drastic action. So with 5 weeks before Airecon I took the decision to change a fundamental part of the game: I moved from using Polyhedral dice to standard D6's with different colours representing different skills. I leaned much more heavily in to the Yahzee idea so now to kick down a door you would need a double red dice (red = physical). It was a lot of work changing everything but the game played so much better for it and what I presented was something I'm super proud of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first quest of the game I have the would-be-champions performing the rather mundane task of investigating what's happened to Georgie the old tavern cat. This will serve as an introduction to how the game playes and some low level enemies. For the finished game I imagine quests will range from these small jobs through to exploring cast caves, temples, fighting dragons and perhaps at the end, even venturing to hell itself! I made some \"I Saved Georgie\" badges and these would be rewards for anyone who managed to complete the first Quest! -Who doesn't want a cute cat badge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe night before Airecon I played the first quest through in solo mode. I played as the Witch (a mostly support role - I was curious if this would be possible) and I had a Stone Ogre Companion, I managed to scrape throught quest and had an awesome time doing it. This game at least meets my objective of being something I found interesting and exciting, and is a game I want to play!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ran 5-6 games of Ultimate Quest over the weekend and several coveted \"I SAVED GEORGIE\" badges were won with each adventuring party having their own unique adventure. One party encountered Vampires and another managed to save an young child from giant spiders! We had a Centaur Warrior torn to pieces by a pack of zombies and these are just a few of the most memorable moments!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've received some great feedback and ideas and I've come away feeling even more inspired, motivated and excited for the future of Ultimate Quest! A huge thank you to everyone who joined me on the adventure and played the game. I can't wait to see where this games goes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra thanks goes to beckyriotus for taking some lovely photos and compiling a couple of lovely video clips of the gaming action!\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/next-generation-dating-app-live/","title":"Next generation dating apps are live","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n🎉 Today Apple have approved my final app which means Rocketware's next generation dating apps are now live across both Google Play and Apple Store! 🥳\nIt's a big milestone for me. These are the apps that I've built the business on and over the last decade they've been used by millions of LGBTQI+ people worldwide. The new apps offer an experience that is more modern, inclusive and maintainable. Hopefully these new apps will provide an equally solid foundation for the business over the next decade.\nApp store screenshots\nHere's a sample of the new app store screenshots for the Only Women brand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the next milestone?\nIn the short term I'll be continuing to refine the new app experience and expand the customer service tools and systems. I also have a rather innovative marketing project that's ready to go live that involves AI. I hope it will drive traffic to the new apps. I'll be launching it as soon as I get the necessary API access -although when that will be it out of my control!\nThe next major milestone is retiring the legacy dating platform 'Datingnode'. The dating web sites built on this platform are still running and they continue to be profitable so it will be some time before I'm ready to fully turn them off. It will be great when I can turn the servers off as when that's done, I will have fully transitioned to the next chapter of my dating services and fully embraced the all cloud future!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/neurodiversity-dyslexia-and-adhd/","title":"Neurodiversity: Dyslexia and ADHD","body":"\nNeurodiversity (noun) Variety in human behavioural traits and brain function, viewed as normal variation within the population.\n\n\nFirstly let me just say that writing a blog post about 'me' feels a little self-indulgent. Despite this being my blog, I try not to include details about me or photos of me etc. I keep my socials locked down and try to keep my digital footprint minimal. I'm going to write this as I'd quite like to document how I feel and talking about this stuff is no bad thing.\n\nIn case you don't know me I better start by saying I'm in my late thirties and an all round content person. I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 14 and haven't thought much of it since. I've just started the process of getting an ADHD diagnosis and this is how it came around:\nFor as long as I can remember I really get in to projects, like really into them, to the point I really struggle to sleep until I've finished them. I obsess over details and possible permutations and like a broken record I can't change the track. I've previously questioned if I had OCD because it does feel like obsessions but that doesn't fit as I don't have any 'compulsions'. I can't choose what triggers these but it's always something I find interesting -usually a creative endeavor. Thankfully these are usually work or hobby related which results in me being really productive. The downside of that is during these periods I sometimes go for weeks without proper sleep and I neglect other parts of life. I also generally feel frantic, it feels like my mind is always racing and moments of clam or silence are few and far between. I've previously questioned if this was normal but dismissed it as just being passionate about my projects.\nLast week during a work related online conference the speaker talked about her ADHD \"fixations\" -what she described sounded very familiar to me. After the call I did a little research in to ADHD and the symptoms sounded as if someone who knew me really well was describing me. So many things I had put down to personality quirks were listed here (things like being a total over-thinker, frequently zoning out when people talk to me, forgetfulness, missing details &amp; selective hearing, struggling with organising myself and neglecting general admin, can be socially clumsy -especially after a drink, real difficulty motivating myself to do something I don't want to do, easily distractable when not working on something interesting, distracted by background sounds, even light-sensitivity!). Those 'obsessions' I get are apparently known as 'fixations' and the period of single-minded productivity is known as 'hyper-focus'. The physically squirmy and fidgety symptom doesn't fit me, but I do feel like that on a mental level -I struggle to sit though a film or watch TV for longer than an hour as it feels too passive. I'm still processing how I feel about it all, it's great to have identified it as I can now learn more about it. However so much of what I thought was unique about me are symptoms of this thing that's described as a 'disorder' and 'disability'!\nADHD clinical diagnosis &amp; connection to dyslexia\nI tried a few of the ADHD online screening tools and I scored high-very high in each one. I've spoken to my local GP and she was very kind and has confirmed she will refer me for clinical diagnosis. There's a 2+ years wait if I go with the NHS, or around an 18 months if I go use the NHS Right to Choose scheme which means they'll cover the costs for a third party diagnoses via one of their selected partners.\nThe GP was particularly interested in my Dyslexia asking a number of questions about it. She told me that there is a connection between Dsylexia and creativity. She also introduced me to the #madebydyslexia campaign that lists lots of innovators and creative thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Steve Jobbs and Richard Branson. I hadn't spared my dyslexia any thought for my entire life, I just considered it as the annoying thing that meant I can't spell and write like a child ...not as a character defining part of me! It turns out 30% of people with Dyslexia also have ADHD so there certainly seems to be correlation.\nSo what now?\nI've filled out the Right to Choose documentation and given it to the GP and I now need to wait for an unknown amount of time (suggestions are it could be anything from weeks to years). I'm not in a rush, I've got by fine for this long but learning more about it will certainly be welcome.\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/creating-a-pride-collection-for-2023/","title":"Creating a pride collection for 2023","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year I buy at least one new pride top to wear.

Check out all my designs over the gallery and if you like them go buy yourself something in my little Redubbule store!\nThe collection of designs is all based around the pink triangle and the word LOVE. In case you don't know the pink triangles were used in concentration camps to identify gay men. It's since been reclaimed as a symbol of resilience and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the main design from the collection.\n\nL is a triangle filled with the pride colours including the black and brown representing people of colour. Each colour is represented equally.\nO is a perfect cricle with an inner purple circle outline. This represents the Intersex flag, yellow and purple are colours considered free from gender associations and the circle's represent wholeness and completeness.\nV is the Pink Triangle, as explained above this symbol comes from dark history now reclaimed as a symbol of love and resilience. It also is a good reminder for us all not to forget our history so not to make the same mistakes again.\nE is represented by three horizontal lines in the Transgender pride colours (Blue, Pink and White). Three lines horizontal lines is the scientific equality symbol. This symbolises equality for Trans lives and Trans rights.\n\nI hope you like the designs, and if you do you can buy them over at Redbubble!

This updates was really well received and I personally think it's a huge step forward for the app! The app has received some lovely reviews over the week of Eurovision and is now 4.8⭐️/5⭐️ on both Google Play and Apple App Store!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial scorecards and account system\nThe headline feature for this year is social scorecards. I came up with this idea last year when a friend casually asked if at her Eurovision party they could all score together on my app? I told her she couldn't but that was a fabulous idea! (Thanks Ellie!) Group scoring is an addition to the scorecard system for 2 years back. It allows you to create a 'Group'. During the development of this I was chatting to another friend (Queenie this time) and they asked if the group would have a combined scorecard -another fab idea! Initially I had planned for it to just allow you to see each others scorecards and share your realtime reactions (with emoji) but this would elevate the feature so I pushed to add this and prioritised it over seeing each others scorecards.\nI wanted to make this work for large groups. As a member of OGAE UK (The UK's official Eurovision fan club) which around 1k members - I wanted to make sure that if a club used it, then it would work. I decided on setting a limit of 500 members for each group and worked backwards from that. Each minute a cloud function would trigger which would look for any active group scorecards, and generate the latest scorecard for that group. I could increase this to every 30 seconds during the week of Eurovision - maybe this is something I'll do in the future. People can also add emoji reactions which are shown to the group in realtime. There is a limit on the frequency these can be posted by individuals based on the group size. I added some simple management tools to the UI so the group owner manage their group.\nI really think this feature is my apps 'Killer feature', it's something that no other app does and something I don't anticipate anyone else doing. It's quite a complex thing, and with this not being a money making app it would take someone as crazy as me to invest time in to making it work!!\n(To do: Add a video of the group scorecard feature)\n\nEverything is now free! 💸\nSpeaking of this app not making much money -I've decided to make everything free this year. When I first implemented scorecards I set a restriction that the current/latest year required a paid 'VIP Pass' (£2.99 one off for a year or £1.99 per/year subscription). The app has always made very little money and if I want my scorecard feature to be used by lots of people then I need to life that restriction. So this year I've kept the concept of a 'VIP Pass' but I give people the choice: Watch an advert for a temporary pass or buy a subscription (£1.99 for the year or £10.99 for life). I'm really happy with this change as now the people can download my app and use it fully without paying a penny, it also works for those that don't want to watch an advert so would rather subscribe or just buy it once and own it forever. The little bit of revenue I receive contributes towards the running costs of the app.\n\nNew scorecard themes &amp; layouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've added a 4 new scorecard themes and 2 scorecard layouts. I intend to add more in the future but this is a decent upgrade over the single theme and layout up to now.\n\nSo that wraps up my updates for 2023, if you haven't downloaded ESC Party yet then what the heck are you waiting for? -download it now, the links are available on my apps project page!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/lego-kirby/","title":"Making a Lego kirby artwork","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Checkout the photos of my finished creation hanging on the wall.\nI received a Lego 'Art Project' (set #21226) from an in-law for Christmas. It's a great set that comes with a load of dots and x9 plates (16x16) which combine to make a decent sized 48x48 stud base for an artwork. I skipped the suggested pictures in the instructions and went off-piste with a picture of one of my favourite Nintendo characters, Kirby but toward the end of the build I had ran out of the colours I needed. I considered buying another set so I could double-up but ended up buying the 'Floral Art' (set #31207) as it was cheaper and came with a load of pink dots. I had (wrongly) calculated that the additional x6 plates (16x16) from the floral set would mean I could create one large 64x64 artwork. I had totally done my maths wrong and I was one plate short which I had to order later along with some additional dots!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my 64x64 image I wanted something that was fun and colourful. I played around making pixel art images of Princess Peach and Link from the Legend of Zelda but came around full circle back to Kirby, that cute little pink ball meets my criteria of being very fun and nice and colourful. One of the challenging parts of creating the my image was coming up with something that would (mostly) use the colours and quantities of lego dots that I had. I found a picture created by Kittykun123 on deviant art which I really liked. I reworked the image by adding a rainbow trail, simplifying some of the details and reducing the colour palette (as I was limited to the lego colours). I then pixelated the image and cleaned it up on Aseprite. I hadn't done much pixel art before but I really enjoyed the process! Above you can see the pixel art I came up with, I broke it in x12 16x16 blocks as this would make the tiling easier for me. I had this image open on my tablet as I created the lego picture!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did the build in two phases as I ran out of the colours I needed. I used an online pixel colour counting service which told me how exactly many of each colour I needed so I put an order in on Bricklink for the remaining colours and the extra 16x16 plate.\nI'm really happy with the way this turned out. I can't wait to hang it on the wall (update: see it on my wall). I'm going to keep the picture of Kirby for the forseeable future but I might change it up at some point -it is Lego after all!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/next-generation-of-my-dating-apps/","title":"Launching the next generation of my dating apps","body":"I'm super happy to be able to say that the first app using my next generation dating platform is now available in both Goolge Play store and Apple App Store. I've launched one of my brands 'One Scene' using the new platform. This will be a bit of a test before I start moving over the bigger brands.\nIt's been a long road to getting here so I'll quickly get you up to speed...\n\nA brief history of Rocketware &amp; dating apps\nI created my company Rocketware back in 2011. My company's first product was a white label dating platform called 'Datingnode'. I built it around the LGBTQI+ community and it's been steadily ticking over for the last 13 years. Almost 6 million members have registered over the years and about half of those are currently active on the platform. Over the years Datingnode has provided dating services for some great brands, GT (UK's biggest gay lifestyle magazine), DIVA (UK's largest lesbian lifestyle magazine), Pink Paper (UK LGBTQI+ news portal &amp; newspaper), GayXchange (dating TV channel) as well as my only brands including Only Women and Only Lads that are reasonably well known within the LGBTQI+ community.\nDatingnode was initially launched as a white label dating solution for dating websites. It was 2011 and websites were still king. Only a year later everything changed when Tinder launched, the dating industry evolved over night. Over the years there have been various iterations of Datingnode:\n\n2011: Datingnode white label platform launches\n2012: Datingnode apps available in app stores utilising Titanium/Appcelerator to wrap Javascript web apps\n2016: New API alongside native Android and Native Objective-C iOS apps released\n2017: New website launches built upon the 2016 API.\n2018-2020: Developed new Angular Dart PWA (Progressive web app), although this app never saw the light of day!\n2020-2023: Developed new entirely new dating product which is what I've launched this week.\n\n(TODO: Add screenshots here)\n\n🤔 So what happened to the 2018 app?\nIn 2018 I started creating and new dating app built on the Datingnode API. The app was written in Angular and it interfaced with the API by an SDK that was generated from the Datingnode JSON API specification file. To help me on this project I took on a senior very experienced developer for around 18 months. This would be my first commercial Dart project and having someone on-board that has written battle-hardened dart code was reassuring.\nWe slogged away at it for almost 2 years, the app came together and when it did I was pretty proud of it -it really was a very accomplished web app. A week or two away from launch I took the very difficult decision to not launch it and throw away the huge investment that my company had made in to it over the last 24 months.\nOne morning sat in my co-working space and I was trying to wrap up those loose-ends. I didn't feel good about launching the app and I couldn't put my finger on why. I then had a crazy thought -\"What start all over again\" -and I didn't mean just the client app, I mean the whole shebang... Reinvent Datingnode from the ground up. The moment this idea had entered my head it was over all for the Angular client and Datingnode too. I felt terrible about the wasted money but I felt hugely relieved, I knew that launching another Datingnode app was subscribing me to another 5+ years of Datingnode. Datingnode had grown long in the tooth, it's API was huge and complex. It was the very definition of a monoalithic app, it ran on physical servers and them breaking would often ruin weekends, evenings even holidays! Maybe it was a case of the grass is greener but I had already mentally taken the leap, I was invested in the idea of starting with a clean slate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🤣 I keep this in mind whenever I start a new project -to remind myself not to fall in to the trap!\n\nReimaging my dating product 10 years later\nIgnoring the fact I've just wasted 2 years of work and paid a rockstar developers salary for 18 months, I was in a pretty privileged position. I had a relatively passive income and a bit of a runway to re-imagine my dating product. Here are the ideologies I came up with:\n\nDeveloped for the cloud: I wanted my dev-ops to be mostly someone elses problem. Not only would I utilise cloud technology I would design for it. I would utilise managed services where I could to maximise redundancy and security. Yes you pay a premium for the fancy technology but I'm a strong believe in do what you you do well, and for me that's making software, not settings up and maintaining the infrastructure.\nProperly Gender inclusion: The vast majority of dating services that are available today handle gender-identity inclusion poorly. Even if they let users choose their gender identity it still comes down to binary male or female when it comes to the matching. To support gender-identities properly the service needs to be designed around this concept - not just adapted to it. On my new dating service, gender identities are treated equally not as subsets of male or female.\nMutual likes to chat: Thank you Tinder, this is one of the two great innovations we have Tinder to thank. The principle that both parties must be interested in one-another before communication can happen solves many problems with traditional dating services. It also is a great way to stop the service being abused by spammers and (unsophisticated) bots. This would be baked in to my new dating experience.\nA modern UI built with Flutter: I knew straight away that Flutter to build my new app. As a Dart developer this was the current hotness and it would allow me to have Android and iOS apps built from a single codebase. It also meant I could deploy Dart services in the cloud and they could all share the same code base. Dart is the language endgame for me and I'm living the developer dream -a single technology stack (front-end and back-end). In terms of user experience I will incorporate Tinder's other great innovation - the gestural swipe system for sifting through potential matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tip of the iceberg\nI always thought a Dating platform a bit like an iceberg (or ant-hill), the bit people see (the app) makes up about 10% of the project. The other 90% is the customer service tools, the moderation systems, the anti-scam systems, billing systems, the notification systems, marketing etc etc. As I was starting with a clean-slate and new technology stack I've had to rebuild all the tools again. Using the single tech stack and shared code base has been a huge help here. I've created some cloud orchestration tools that allow semi-automated testing and deployment of my cloud-endpoints. The new platform has around 50 cloud endpoints / micro-services - handling everything from registration to AI photo moderation.\nI've created a new management tool and moderation tools using Flutter however this time they're targeting the web giving remote workers easy access using their browser. There's more work to do on this front but the initial tooling is more than adequate for launch.\n\nLaunch plan\nMy long-term goal is to transfer the traffic and revenue from the old Datingnode platform on to the new platform. Hopefully this will happen within 12 months but I'm prepared for it to take longer than my estimate (things usually do!). Once I've established the new platform I'll look at retiring the old platform. I will be popping a large bottle of fizz the day I turn off the old servers! It's going to be a busy year or two but massively exciting. So cheers everyone, I've waiting a long time to let my new dating apps in to wild and today they're available for you all to download! 🎉\nDownload One Scene on Android or iPhone\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/making-pride-badges/","title":"Making Pride badges","body":"I wanted to buy some progressive pride badges for this years pride so I turned to Etsy.

I thought I'll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a £38.99 p/year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!\n\nThe following day, on the very long &amp; hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.\nI worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of £2.99, pay once &amp; own forever. I'm sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I'll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I'll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!\nYou can download Sticker Party on Google Play and on the Apple App Store.

They didn't give me a real explanation or even a chance to appeal their decision. I share my story in the hope that it reaches Google Play and they reevaluate and improve the way they handle cases like mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last few years I've filled my evenings and weekends building a fan app dedicated to the 'Eurovision Song Contest' (an annual song competition), it's been my little hobby/passion project. I blogged about it when I launched it and that post received comments and applause from senior Google engineers and the official Firebase Twitter account even tweeted about it. The app has come a long way since then and I totally rewrote the front-end to make use of the lovely Flutter framework. I've translated the app (and even the app store listing) in to every language used throughout Europe (via the paid-for translation service provided by Google Play). The app was probably the most comprehensive app/resource on the song competition with every contest, entry, artist and thousands of photos and videos dating right back to 1956.\nOne day, entirely out of the blue I received a notice from Google Play saying the app was suspended, it was a generic email and the only bespoke part was highlighted in bold: \"your on-device title does not reflect your app's functionality.\" I've checked the Google Play policy documents and nowhere does it say your apps functionality needs to be reflected in the device title - (See popular apps: Amazon, Bumble etc&nbsp;…nobody's on device app title reflects the apps functionality, they just use their brand name). My app's on device title was 'EurovisionGP' - GP is a nod to the history of the contest as it was originally called Eurovision Grand Prix. The only reason I can think that Google may have taken issue with my app is due to the inclusion of the word 'Eurovision' (which is part of the trademark Eurovision Song Contest). I'm unsure if this is the case as there are so many apps on Google Play that also include the word Eurovision in their title and they haven't been suspended. I would also have expected the suspension email to be very different clearly stating this as the reason if that was the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI sent the Google Play Policy team numerous emails offering to entirely re-brand (and to even change the on device title to reflect my apps functionality!) and I received a single response from 'Alexis' simply stating that my app would not be reinstated. That was the last time I heard from the Google Play Policy team despite me sending them numerous emails offering anything I could think of to resolve this issue. I even reached out to Albert Y. Cheng (Head of Google Play Global Marketing) and Megumi Takada (Google Play Business Development Manager) and pleaded my case, neither responded.\nMy app has been offline for 7 months now and Google Play are unwilling to respond to my messages, where does that leave me? It looks like I'll need to follow the guidelines in the suspension email which states that I'll need to start again with a new app, zero installs &amp; zero reviews, and just hope that Google Play doesn't ban the next app too. Their feedback has been so minimal and it's so ambiguous I don't have any confidence that I know what they took issue with. I used to champion Google Play in the 'most developer friendly app store' debate but this whole debacle has left an absolute bitter taste in my mouth. I'll certainly be sharing this story as far and wide as I can in the hope that Google Play improves the way they handle these situations. Google Play has shown an absolute lack of care towards a developer who has invested time, money and effort, lovingly creating an app for their platform. I'm sure I'm not the first person that's had their app banned without real justification and sadly I probably won't be the last...\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/frogger/","title":"Frogger / Crossy road Playdate remake","body":"I got super excited when the idea to make a frogger / crossy-road game for the playdate hit me.

As the recipient is interested in crypto currencies &amp; blockchain tech, I thought a desk/shelf crypto price ticker would be a cool present. I found a couple of products online but they were either not very good or prohibitively expensive so I decided to have a go at building one myself.\nTLDR: Code available on Github &amp; try it in your browser.\n\nConcept\nI thought it would be cool if the device looked like a retro departures board, periodically cycling through various crypto prices. I wanted it to have low power consumption, always showing the latest prices, configurable &amp; attractive.\nHardware\nAt first I looked at split flap displays but it turns out they’re hard to come by &amp; expensive. I decided to go for an eink display which I figured I could make to look like a split flap display. I’d heard about rooting Kindles and using them in DIY projects so I decided to go down that route, I managed to pick up a Kindle Paperwhite 2 on eBay for the bargain price of £18. Rooting the Kindle was easy enough; details on how to do that are out of the scope of this write up but I’m sure you’ll find all the information you need over on the ‘mobile read’ forum. I then got a Linux desktop running on the Kindle, ready to run my app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\nUsing my language of choice (Dart) I decided to make a web app that would run in a kiosk mode browser. I went for the Midori browser as it has way less overhead than Chromium or Firefox. I designed the UI to look like a 7x3 split flap display. I added a simple character by character transition as the display updates which flows across it just like the old departure boards. Also by setting each character black for a second as it transitions does a lovely job of resetting the eink to avoid any ghosting. For the data source I used the Binance API which was super easy to use. As the Kindle had a touch screen I made it so tapping the left or right side of the screen would cycle between the crypto symbol pairs. I also added a configuration screen which you can access by hitting the central column on the display. The configuration screen allows you to choose which symbol pairs to cycle through and the duration to rest on each. With it being an eink display, having a long time between updates results in much less power consumption. I decided on 60 seconds as the default update time.\nThe final addition to the software was adding the clock mode. At the end of each hour it displays the time so you can watch the turning of the hour. One of my favourite features is I added a sun which rises on the left in the morning, and as each hour passes it moves up and over and sets on the right. When the sun sets the moon comes up and in the midst of the night, the stars come out and twinkle. It think it’s a really playful little addition to the crypto ticker and the concept reminds me of those fancy mechanical cuckoo clocks.\nI’ve made the code open source so you can grab it over on Github. If you don’t want the code but you just want to run it, there are two hosted versions: Mobile/desktop version or dedicated device version.\nFinishing touches\nAs this is something designed to be seen often, it needed to look good. I commissioned an oak lacquered frame at my local carpenters. I detached the Kindle’s front panel and sprayed it white to make it look like an artwork’s border/mount. Finally I did some shopping on eBay and I got a metal frame kick stand for the back and found a nice white power cable. A little homemade label with the serial number 001 completes the look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible upgrades\n\nI may at some point port the code to flutter and compile a Linux desktop app and see how that runs on the Kindle. I imagine this would give cleaner letter transitions &amp; run at a higher frame rate.\nI’ve also been playing around with the Rust language recently, and it would be fun to write a Rust version. It would actually be a really good fit as Rust can run on bare metal embedded systems.\nIt would be cool to buy a dedicated eink display and drive it from a Raspberry Pi (probably a Pi Zero to keep it affordable); You can get single colour eink displays (black, white + red/yellow) for around £50, having colour would open up new possibilities in terms of UI.\nI also thought about buying some individual 2-3\" eink displays (or 7-segment-displays) and using each one of those as a character. This would be quite similar to one of the inspirations of this project (the original block clock). I might order some and have a play around with them for some future project!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nI’ve had loads of fun making this project and I’m super happy with the way the Crypto Clock turned out! I’m sure it’s going to make an awesome gift.\nIf you decide to make a crypto clock please let me know! I’d love to see photos of your creations! :)\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/nighthaunt/","title":"Warcry - Nighthaunt warband","body":"Recently I've been a little obsessed with the Warcry tabletop skirmish game by Games workshop.

It's a tricky problem as I only know terrain lines and nothing else (so I don't know which side is supposed to be solid and which is supposed to be the empty void of space). This shows what I have and what I want to achieve:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can trust that the space ship will always be in space (even if it's hit an asteroid, it should never actually be in the asteroid!). Using that piece of truth I've came up with an idea, if I projected from the ship to the corners and count the terrain line intersections I should be able to figure out what's solid. If the number of intersections is even, I know the corner should be in also in space, if the intersection count was odd, then the corner is in an asteroid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce I knew if the corners were in an asteroid or not, I should then be able to move along each edge and join up the lines.\nImplementation\n\n\nI've implemented the intersection counting, if the line is green then there is an even number of intersections which means the corner is in space, if red then there is an odd number of intersections so this is in the asteroid.\nI've cut the terrain line at the scren edge (and highlighting it with a circle), this is so I can make a nice clean edge on each polygon.\n(Oh you might also notice I've implemented asteroid rotation too!)\n\n\nHere I have implemented the algorithm that combines all the edges in to polygons. At the top there is text that says something like 'P: 2', this means 2 polygons found.\nAt first I was getting a weird graphical glitch when filling my polygons which I realised was due to the fact my polygons are concave. Filling concave polygons turns out is a technically tricky as the polygon needed triangulating (chopping in to simple triangles). Luckily Love2d has a triangulate feature that I could use. I coloured the triangles random colours to highlight the triangulation process.\n\n\n...ta-dah! Here is the finished product. I'm super happy (&amp; surprised) that my crazy idea worked!\nI now need to reimplement the ship, but I'm a little hesitant to continue with Lua due to it being so difficult to debug (and I'm really missing static-typing!). I'm thinking about switching to C or possibly Rust to continue my playdate journey.\nI apologise for the noisy strangely coloured gif's -I really need to level up by gif skills!\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/eurovision-game-2-the-card-game/","title":"Eurovision game 2.0 - The card game!","body":"My previous Eurovision game took around two of prototyping countless versions and lots and lots of playtesting but I never felt I was tottally satisfied with it. About 6 weeks ago I started working on a tottally new reminaged game and today I've finally finished creating the first proper protoytpe complete with artwork. Read on to here about how it plays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame design\n\nBringing some succesful parts of the previous game forward: There was a lot of really good stuff in the previous game so I brought forward the bits that I were portable and would fit in to this new game. I rescued quite a few bits (including the scoring system), but sadly not all of the good bits were compatible with the new game.\nSwithing to a card game: The previous game had a lots of classic Eurovision moments in, however they never actually felt like those had consequence in the context of the game. Pyrotechnics, vocalists, it just felt like box-ticking. This version I decided to move the majority of the gameplay &amp; combo-building in to cards. By doing this I could really make each of these classic Eurovision moments feel unique and feel right (For instance Yodelling is a great additional genre, but doesn't work so well on it's own!) and smoke machines combo nicely with ballads.\nAdding a spacial puzzle: This gameplay mechanism was born out of the theme. As I thought-through the logistics of putting a Eurovision act together I realised that there is a bit of spcial puzzle at play. You lights need to be pointing at your performers and they dont want to be directly over your pyrotechnicals! This would make a full little tetris puzzle as you piece of your act together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the prototype\n\nI used my dart library deckorator to generate all the cards. That reminds I need to open source that, if anyone wants a copy, nudge me and I'll do it.\nI cut out my cards with a craft knife which is much better than scissors or an average guillatine. I also purchased a corner cutter which rounds the corners, it makes such a difference and really finishes the cards off nicely.\nTo keep the prototype in good condition I put the cards in mayday premium sleeves\n\nSo how does it play?\nI've made quite a few games now, and encouraged friends, family, my partner and even strangers to play them, and although some of my games have been really enjoayable, most haven't lived up to my expectations. However this game is different, it actually feels really great. It feels like it all just fits together so harmously, the game plays so smoothly and feels really thematic. A friend described it saying it's got just the right balance of simplicity and strategy.\nI'm hoping to approach Eurovision with this game, and maybe get permission to Kickstart it or somehow get it published.

Earlier this year I secured some great tickets to the Eurovision Song Contest and in the excitement I decided to build a modern web app to explore and discover the history of the annual show. I set myself some objectives:\n\nIt should utilise the very latest and greatest web technology.\nIt should contain Eurovision Song Contests historic results and the information should be available in the most used languages in Europe.\nThe data must be easy to maintain (this was the tricky bit!).\n\nTldr: Here’s the app (as of 2020 I've retired this version in favour of my newer flutter app) I built and below are the details of how I put it together &amp; the challenge I encountered, video demo at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA progressive app and a progressive attitude\n‘Progressive Web Apps’ (or ‘PWAs’) are essentially shining exemplars of modern web technologies. They feel more like native apps than they do their creaky website ancestors. PWAs have the ability to work offline, be installed on your devices, and even receive push notifications. I’m a huge advocate of PWAs and I’ve done talks on the subject for my local tech community.\nOver the last year a large part of my everyday work has been building a large PWA to replace a complex established website. For my new Eurovision pet-project I wanted something much leaner and simpler. As well as building the app as PWA, I would challenge myself to approach every decision from the UI to the back-end with a modern progressive attitude.\nA progressive language &amp; framework\nMy language of choice is Dart. It’s strongly typed, fully object orientated and a language that makes me really productive. For web it compiles down to JavaScript. You can even use it to build native mobile apps with Flutter or run Dart on your server or development machine using the Dart VM -it’s the genuine holy grail!\nFor the framework I chose Angular Dart, it’s a great framework that allows you to build robust and sophisticated web apps in a structured and opinionated way. I utilised ‘angular_components’ which are the same battle-hardened material design components that Google use on their own products. I also used the ‘intl’ library which allowed me to extract the text into dictionary files which could then be translated in to various languages.\nBackend as a service\nIn keeping with the progressive philosophy I chose Firebase for the backend. Firebase is a fully managed platform for building applications, these kind of platforms are often referred to as ‘backend as a service’ (‘baas’). With a solution like this, the jobs that traditional servers would do are broken down in to numerous services and you simply pay for what you use. It’s a really hassle-free, modern &amp; progressive approach to application infrastructure and I love it!\nThe challenge of maintaining the data\nThe biggest challenge I faced building this app was how to maintain the data. I really wanted a simple and elegant solution to updating the app but my choice of database-technology made this tricky. As I was using the Firebase backend I choose to use its new fancy Firestore database, however this is a ‘NoSQL’ datastore that doesn’t allow realtime complex querying or aggregating of data across relationships. I would be storing data that has lots of relationships and needed lots of aggregated statistics. Ideally I‘d use a relational database for this kind of dataset but as my objective was to be modern, simple and progressive, I really wanted to avoid the traditional database+server combo.\nUsing Firestore meant I would need to compute all the relationships in my data ahead of time and cache these relationship &amp; aggregated values in my data objects. Doing this also makes updating the data challenging as changing one object would likely have knock on effects to other objects that held a cache of the modified data.\nA frugal solution\nThe solution I came up with to maintain the data was to export it all to a Google Spreadsheet (yes …you read that correctly) and this would become my ‘source of truth’. Using the Spreadsheet I could then rebuild my database whenever required. I essentially use Firestore as a glorified cache. It feels like an unconventional yet rather elegant solution. Here’s is a breakdown of the build process:\n\nDownload the CSV files from the Google spreadsheet.\nUsing the CSV files rebuild all the objects.\nFrom ‘Firebase Cloud Storage’ download the current snapshot of all the objects that are currently stored in the database.\nDiff the newly built objects with the downloaded database snapshot.\nPrompt the user with a summary of changes asking them if they wish to apply these changes.\nApply the diff to the Firestore database.\nUpload the newly built objects to ‘Firebase Cloud Storage’ as the latest database snapshot. This will be used next time the build process is run.\n\nI love this solution for the following reasons:\n\nI didn’t have to write loads of data-management code: logic, forms, validation etc. I just setup some validation rules and conditional formatting on the spreadsheet. This left my codebase nice, clean and simple.\nRebuilding from scratch every time inadvertently solves one of my main gripes with NoSQL data stores: when you refactor your data structures you can end up with inconsistencies across a collection due to the lack of collection-wide schemas. This mitigates the problem by simply patching any changes you make across the entire dataset.\nThe thing that blows my mind is that this runs in the client browser (as there is no conventional server in this equation). It feels like only a short-while ago that browsers would struggle to do anything complex client-side and now they’re capable compiling thousands of objects from a remote collection of CSVs, diffing, patching then reuploading without even breaking a sweat.

I've implemented them countless times in various programming languages. A couple of weeks back I created a Dart library for exploring playing with Cellular Automata, it's open source and available on Github. You can browse the demos on github or see the library running on my personal website -the gifs on this article were also generated using the library.\n\nWhat are Cellular Automata?\nCellular Automata were all the rage in Science and Math clubs back in the 70s &amp; 80s however the first papers on the subject actually date way back to the 40s. In those days mathematicians &amp; scientists created the rules using pen and paper rather than a computer (John Conway actually created his 'Game of Life' rules on a Go board!). Stephen Wolfram wrote numerous papers on the subject in the 80s &amp; 90s.\nA Cellular Automaton is a grid of 'cells', each of which has a single 'state'. For each cycle (known as a new 'generation') a set of rules are applied to each cell in the grid which could potentially change it's state. The rules usually consider each of the cells 'neighbourhood' (the surrounding cells). Cellular Automata rules are usually incredibly simple. Below are the rules to 'Conway's Game of Life' (here is my library's code implementation):\n\nAny living cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\nAny living cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\nAny living cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a living cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\n'Conway's Game of Life' (among many other rules) can be described as Turing-complete, meaning they can perform computations (if the necessary cell states are in particular formations — like this). Wire World is another incredibly simple rule that allows the simulation of electronic logic elements —the 80s equivalent of Minecraft's redstone circuits!\nWhat fascinates me is that from such a simple set of rules, complex systems can arise. Often stable groups of cells occur and large complex formations that can even move as a single unit. Reoccurring patterns arise that can span numerous generations (there's a simple 3 generational pattern in the header graphic). I find this aspect of Cellular Automata so exciting -you never know what you are going to see. It's as if we're simulating a very basic universe. What would happen if rather than a very simple 2D grid of cells, we simulated protons, neutrons &amp; electrons? Would we also see complex structures appear; or even simulated life? (aside: Simulation hypothesis)\nThe Dart library\nThe library separates the Cellular Automata rules (the fun bit) from the boilerplate processing &amp; rendering. This makes it quick &amp; easy to add new rules or experiment. I've added a few rules so far and also added support for 'MCell' rules so it can run any of the hundreds of rules published in the MCell rules Lexicon. I plan to add the ability to have numerous rule sets running in the same scene although this feature will have to wait for a rainy day. The rendering code is also decoupled which means you can easily add/swap renderers as you need, I've already added a few (WebGL, Canvas, Html) and I plan to add another that can drive an LED Matrix.\n\nThe dart package 'cellular_automata' is published on pub.dartlang.org. Have fun with it and don't forget to send me a pull request! ;-)\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/rocketbox-javascript-game-toolkit/","title":"RocketBox - HTML5 Toolkit","body":"I've create numerous HTML5 apps recently and each time I start a new one, I go through the same process getting all the core components in place. This takes an hour or so and once complete I can finally start working on the actual app. It's for this reason that I decided to create RocketBox - a html5 game/demo/app toolkit. It's essentially a blackbox that abstracts away a lot of the headaches and boring stuff that developers face when they start a new project.\nFeatures\n\nFront-end player &amp; UI for canvas based applications\nScaling handling\nFullscreen support\nEvents system\nRender loop timer\nDebug &amp; logging system\nSupports multiple apps per page\n\nThere are other benefits to this project too: future features can be added which an app will benefit from without having to touch it's code base (ie: fullscreen feature will implement the fullscreen API further down the line), the app's won't need updating, it just works. It also means that all your games/demos follow a uniform structure, making it nice and easy to implement in a blog etc (plus RocketBox also supports multiple instances per page).\nView/Download: RocketBox Github Project (as always, I welcome pull requests! :)\n\n\n\nThe demo above demonstrates a basic app integrating with RocketBox, below you can see/download the code.

It's the fastest &amp; most extensible IDE I've come across. Most of my projects reside on local virtual machines, I do this for development &amp; production environment consistency, development machine portability and I don't want to clutter up OSX, my desktop OS. This setup always results in an IDE headache: how to develop on OSX and automagically sync my changes to my various Linux VMs. When using Eclipse (my previous IDE of choice), I'd use the RSE plugin, which would allow me to have remote projects via SSH. SublimeText2 doesn't offer many features out of the box and it's left to you to choose how to setup your IDE by adding plugins. The plugin API is pretty simple, all python based so I decided to create a simple tool which would rsync my projects to my Linux VMs.\nView/Download Project: SublimeRsyncer on GitHub\nI've not too much experience with Python so if this is your area you'll probably cringe at my sloppy syntax and dodgy use of threading so not to block the UI.

A huge thanks to Kate Russell (pictured) for the great feature.\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/jewels-game/","title":"HTML5 Jewels Switching Game","body":"\n\nI'd bet that everyones been hooked on Bewjewled, ZooKeeper or another tile switching game at some point or another. Me and my partner whilst travelleing went through a phase trying to beat each others scores on the mobile variety of this genre which is what led me to the fun challenge of recreating this type of game in JavaScript.\nDeveloping the game\nThe project came together pretty quickly (a couple of sofa coding sessions), I was surpised at how tricky it was finding a decent way to store the grid and transision between which row the blocks are on. I tried a few different methods before finalising on a block array, a block object map and a grid object which stored a block reference for each of its coordinates.\nThere was a niggling issue I had with the frst version - not all the blocks were totally syncronised. The initial version was mostly callback driven, so if the user switched some blocks it would trigger the callbacks regadless of a where the game was in it's main loop. This resulted in blocks being slightly out of sync, maybe by only a millisecond or two but I wanted everything to fall perfectly in sync! After a bit of hacking I sorted this issue and it now keeps everything in sync by queuing jobs up and executing them syncronously at the correct time in the game loop.\n\nLayout &amp; Rendering\nI took a slightly different approach to layout this time and I really like it. I consider the variable width &amp; height to be 100 - as in 100%. As I know how many columns &amp; rows I want I can calculate what position they're at, for example a block that is stationary in row 5, column 7, would\nIn the version below I've temporarily \"borrowed\" the ZooKeeper sprites to test using bitmap graphics. When I get round to finishing this I'll have original graphics!\n\nFinding possible switches\nWhen the current game runs out of possible switches it needs to know so it can act on it (usually the board resets if no more moves). In order to find the possible switches I broke down game logic in to 3 patterns which cover all possible switches. Every time the grid changes I recalculate the switches by testing every block against these 3 patterns horozontally &amp; vertically.\nSwitch Pattern 1\n\nSwitch Pattern 2\n\nSwitch Pattern 3\n\nThe demo below highlights the possible switches by rendering a line connecting the blocks. It will randomly switch blocks, to stop it from running out of switches I'm also randomly removing blocks &amp; rows. (If you notice that sometimes the switches fail it's because it's not considering if the blocks haven't finished falling in to position, if they are this will result in a switch fail!).\n\nThe jewels game to-do list\nThe game mechanics are all mostly there now. The next things I'll add to this will be:\n\n\nScores &amp; Combos\n\nLevel based difficulty system. Each level score target &amp; time to reach that score\n\nOriginal graphics! (any designers out there?!)\n\nLeaderboards\n\nFun stuff! I'm sure I'll come up with some fun new features I can add that will make my jewel switching game a little different!\n\nStay tuned for a future updates!\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/letter-bubbles-typing-game/","title":"Letter Bubbles: HTML5 typing game","body":"Back in 1999 I wrote a frantic arcade style touch typing game in Visual Basic (ew!). Someone reminded me of the game and I decided to recreate the game using modern web technologies such as HTML5 Canvas &amp; Audio elements. I stayed as true to the original as I could and pleased that I managed to port the game almost identically. Check the youtube vid below to see the game being played on insane difficulty.\n\nHere is a video giving an overview of some of the features:\n\nGive the game a go over at letterbubbles.com (No longer online)\nTechnical Details\nBelow's a few technical details regarding the development of the game.\nClosure library and why\nI wanted a JavaScript library or framework that would allow me to develop using a classical object orientated style and didn't restrict me in terms of application structure. I ended up choosing Closure Library for these reasons as well as that it's compatible with the Closure Compiler. By compiling my game (using the advanced optimisation flag) allowed me to somewhat obfuscate the source code which would make cheating somewhat tricker.\nGraphics via canvas\nThe graphics are all done via drawing directly to the canvas (there are zero sprites/bitmaps in the game). The game runs at a steady 30 frames per second and profiling reveals that the vast majority of the render time drawing the circles/bubbles/htmls5 arcs. Maybe if I ever get around to writting a sequel I'll create a WebGL renderer!\nMulti-channel audio\nThe HTML5 audio element isn't great, I ended up creating a class which created multiple audio elements (programatically and never assigned to the DOM) which allowed my various sound effects to be played over multiple channels simultaneously. I'll try to go in to this with code examples later.\nLeaderboards &amp; security\nBack in 1999 I didn't finished implementing the global leaderboards so this was something I really wanted to make sure I had in this time around. The big challenge was how to implement the feature securely to avoid people cheating. I didn't find a solution to this problem and truth be told I don't think there really is a way you can avoid people cheating in a javascript based game.\nOne of the measures I implemented is a security token to verify the game submission, this is made up of a combination of all the game statistics including the games ID, this is the reverified on the server before the result is accepted to avoid the easy hacker packet sniffing and altering the JSON score submission. Of course this only protects against this single type of attack but it's by adding little deterrents like this that I believe make the hack more effort than it's worth which is why I've had so few people actaully hacking the game and submitted bogus scores.\nAs I mentioned earlier by compiling the game source using Closure Compiler also helps deter people as the code isn't instantly in a easily readable format. I've had a few ideas for ways I could create a much more secure game scoring system for a client-side javascript game, maybe one day I'll implement them in to a new game or at least write a blog post about them!\nAnyway, why'd you bother reading all this boring small print?!

There are tiny ants running backward and forward along the bar's balcony and I've decidedo it would be fun to try a little AI coding and create a virtual ant colony! Have a play below.\n\n\n\nThe simulation thus far\nAt the moment my ants aren't very intelligent, they wonder around in a clockwise direction (currently can only turn right... lol) oblivious to the piles of food I've dotted around If you click on an ant you will focus on it, revealing it's name and smell radius, although the ants can't smell yet. Clicking on the floor will tell all the ants to charge to that position, when it gets within their smell radius they'll loose interest.\n\"He's a nice ant\"\nI like the idea that all the ants were different, that's why I gave them names. Also each ant is built a little different from the last, some are bigger but slower, others have longer feelers and a greater smell range. I quite like the idea of introducing different species of ants (red, green &amp; black maybe?), each could be a little different. Maybe in the next version I'll introduce roles or classes, certain ants could be soliders/gathers etc, I guess I'm moving away from a simulator but that wouldn't bother me, it's just a bit of fun anyway!\nAnt animation\nThe ants are visually simple made up of geometric shapes &amp; lines. The body is made up of 3 filled circles &amp; the legs are simply bezier curved lines. To animate the legs I use the sine of distance travelled to generate the leg position difference from where it is when stationary.\n\nAnt food &amp; a sense of purpose\nIn the first demo I dotted piles of food around, the ants are currently oblivious to this. In the next version I will give them the gift of smell, if they get within a certain distance of food they will move to it whilst emitting instructions for ants behind them. This should create a highway to the food piles. The scents (instructions) the ants emmit would also need to slowly decay. Maybe then I'd need to introduce a concept of 'home' or a base for where they could deposit their swag.. Ohhh I could get quite carried away with this! :)\n\nStay tuned for future updates to the cyber ant colony! :-)\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/gallery/","title":"Gallery","body":"I enjoy making things and find doing something creative is particularly relaxing.
